00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:35.453
Richard Nixon: And so let us

2
00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:35.453
start a long march... together.

3
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.206
Not in lockstep

4
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:42.334
but on different roads

5
00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:44.462
leading to the same goal.

6
00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:51.469
The goal of building

7
00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:51.469
a world structure

8
00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:54.138
of peace and justice,

9
00:00:55.848 --> 00:01:00.060
in which all may stand together

10
00:00:55.848 --> 00:01:00.060
with equal dignity.

11
00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.104
Bill Clinton: First of all,

12
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.231
our markets are already open

13
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.231
to China.

14
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.901
This agreement

15
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.901
will open China's market to us.

16
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.861
George W. Bush: I would call

17
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.861
our relationship with China

18
00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:12.448
very positive... and complex.

19
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.368
Barack Obama: The free market

20
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.368
is the greatest force

21
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:18.496
for economic progress

22
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:18.496
in human history.

23
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.040
Donald Trump:

24
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.040
I will make a great deal

25
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.250
and lots of great deals

26
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.250
for the American people.

27
00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:25.169
(echoing) Believe me!

28
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.008
(siren wailing)

29
00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.395
Dan: What is capitalism?

30
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.486
Is it an economic system?

31
00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:57.242
Or is it an apparatus

32
00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:57.242
that we can use

33
00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.495
to make more money

34
00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.495
for ourselves

35
00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.121
and take more money

36
00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.121
from others?

37
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.417
I think, at its heart,

38
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.587
it rewards those who work hard,

39
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.423
but it also rewards

40
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.423
those who...

41
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:16.261
are willing to...

42
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:16.261
take advantage of others.

43
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:20.099
- (indistinct chatter)

44
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:20.099
- (sirens and horns blaring)

45
00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:31.694
There are no good guys

46
00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:31.694
in this story...

47
00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:34.864
including me.

48
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.169
(crew murmuring indistinctly)

49
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:51.630
- Yeah, yeah, that's good.

50
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:51.630
- Okay...

51
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.675
Man: What's your earliest memory

52
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.675
from childhood?

53
00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:00.222
- That's a trick question.

54
00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:00.222
- Man: Is it?

55
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.308
I... was not expecting it.

56
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.979
I don't know what my earliest

57
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.979
memory from childhood was.

58
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.774
I imagine I was two years old

59
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.774
and I was busting

60
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:10.983
a fraud somewhere.

61
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.068
(chuckles)

62
00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:13.778
Narrator: This is Dan David.

63
00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:17.615
(train rattling)

64
00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:21.285
The first time I met him,

65
00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:21.285
we had a couple of drinks

66
00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.704
at a TGI Fridays

67
00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.704
in Penn Station,

68
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.041
and he told me

69
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.041
an almost unbelievable story.

70
00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:32.130
Before the dust had settled

71
00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:34.882
on the economic collapse

72
00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:34.882
of 2008,

73
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.509
Wall Street had already

74
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.509
figured out a new way

75
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.303
to package garbage as gold.

76
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.806
They were engineering

77
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.806
an enormous fraud

78
00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:43.057
that spanned the globe.

79
00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.185
But this time,

80
00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.185
the lies at the center

81
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.353
of the scam were

82
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.353
100 percent legal.

83
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.524
This time,

84
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.524
the crime was based in China.

85
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.901
(train rattling)

86
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.154
(crow cawing)

87
00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:59.782
Narrator: Dan's part

88
00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:59.782
of the story begins here,

89
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.617
far from Wall Street.

90
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.997
The small investment shop

91
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.997
he ran with his partner Maj

92
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.499
had just been crushed

93
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.499
by the stock market crash.

94
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.126
Three o'clock. What's goin' on?

95
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.252
Dan: People who had hedge funds

96
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.252
in 2008

97
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.797
closed their funds

98
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.797
and started a new fund.

99
00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.799
- Chris, you got anything?

100
00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.799
- Finishing working on

101
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.425
what I'm working on now.

102
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.425
I'm just gonna...

103
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.469
We decided right away

104
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.469
we weren't gonna do that.

105
00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:22.638
We were gonna make everybody

106
00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:22.638
their money back.

107
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.516
Narrator: They needed big gains,

108
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.516
quickly.

109
00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:27.226
But with the whole

110
00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:27.226
Western world

111
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.894
on the brink

112
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.894
of another depression,

113
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.771
prospects seemed bleak.

114
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.273
(thunder rumbling)

115
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.653
Narrator: It wasn't hopeless

116
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.653
everywhere, though.

117
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.032
The people in the know

118
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.032
steered Dan to China.

119
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.826
It was this exploding market.

120
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.329
Soren: It was the only market

121
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.329
that people actually

122
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.207
were confident

123
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.207
would go up, was China.

124
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.126
Mitch: This is gonna be

125
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.126
the largest economy

126
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.126
in the world.

127
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.585
Let's invest in it now.

128
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.547
It blew my mind 'cause

129
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.547
it was so completely different

130
00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:58.423
from what I thought

131
00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:58.423
it would be it was booming.

132
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.677
Crocker: There were certain

133
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.677
cities, you'd go one time,

134
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.804
and you'd go a year later

135
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.804
again, and suddenly there'd be

136
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.348
a whole new shopping district

137
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.348
that didn't exist last time.

138
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:11.311
Gold rush.

139
00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.441
There was almost no company

140
00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.441
that you could invest in

141
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.279
in 2009 that was China-based

142
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.279
that you would lose money on.

143
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:23.282
Roddy: For an American

144
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:23.282
set of eyes looking at this,

145
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.034
you were just like,

146
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.034
"Well, my gosh,

147
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.452
"China really is

148
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.452
this golden land

149
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.496
of rapid economic growth."

150
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.456
I really thought,

151
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.456
"Well, jeez, you know,

152
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.917
"the American century

153
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.917
is over now.

154
00:05:33.084 --> 00:05:34.252
This is it."

155
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.379
(seagulls screeching,

156
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.379
waves crashing)

157
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.467
Narrator: Everyone wanted

158
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.467
a piece of China.

159
00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.595
There was just one problem,

160
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.556
foreigners like Dan

161
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.556
couldn't invest directly

162
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:48.766
in Chinese markets.

163
00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.810
That's where the small

164
00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.810
California bank

165
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.104
Roth Capital came in.

166
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.273
(indistinct chatter,

167
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.273
phone ringing)

168
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.066
Narrator: Roth found a niche

169
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.066
that the big banks

170
00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:00.027
had overlooked,

171
00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:00.027
taking small Chinese companies

172
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.821
and listing them directly

173
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.821
on U.S. stock exchanges.

174
00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.700
Now Dan and others like him

175
00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.700
could participate

176
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.410
in the Chinese

177
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.410
economic miracle,

178
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.579
and the bank's

179
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.579
young salesmen had the chance

180
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:12.497
to make a killing

181
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:12.497
with the right pitch.

182
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.374
Hey, Jed,

183
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.374
how are you doing today?

184
00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:16.127
Great, what do you got?

185
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.378
Well, we're working

186
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.378
on this new company.

187
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.172
Would you like to hear

188
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.172
about a transaction?

189
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.382
Two days go by. Five days go by.

190
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.759
Do you have

191
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.759
any interest in this?

192
00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:25.636
This is what we feel

193
00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:25.636
the company's capacity

194
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.054
can go to

195
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.054
after this acquisition.

196
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.889
These are fully registered

197
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.889
securities.

198
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.057
What do you want to do?

199
00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:31.850
If they did have interest,

200
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:32.977
they would come back to you.

201
00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:34.312
Yes. Yes.

202
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.729
Yeah, I'm interested.

203
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:36.897
$2 million worth.

204
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:37.898
Put me in for that.

205
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.024
Okay, great.

206
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.318
And that would be it.

207
00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:43.779
I tried to make myself

208
00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:43.779
be in the flow.

209
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.281
Think of a running river.

210
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.617
21 million bucks?

211
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.617
That's a pretty good fee.

212
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.577
- So let's say this is--

213
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.577
- Man: I'm worried, though.

214
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.038
I'm worried that the numbers

215
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.038
don't hold up from China.

216
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.208
Well, I never got asked that.

217
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.794
(chuckles)

218
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.794
No one ever asked that.

219
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.214
(seagulls screeching)

220
00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.384
Roth is a second, third-tier

221
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.761
boutique investment bank

222
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.761
from California.

223
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.430
Someone else had described it

224
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.430
as a frat house.

225
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:12.557
(chuckles)

226
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.020
Herb: Roth Capital would

227
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.020
get behind small companies

228
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:17.771
and push them out

229
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:17.771
into the market.

230
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.943
They definitely

231
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.943
were heating up 2010, 2011.

232
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.738
Dan: Roth was well known

233
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.738
for doing China deals

234
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.448
at a time

235
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.448
when we were looking.

236
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.952
We went to a couple

237
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.952
of Roth conferences.

238
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.078
It was a good time.

239
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.497
(static crackling)

240
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.167
Woman: Roth Capital Partners

241
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.167
has been organizing conferences

242
00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:40.169
for years in Orange County,

243
00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:40.169
California.

244
00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.754
This has got to be

245
00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.754
the best conference in America.

246
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.507
Company after company you

247
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.507
may have never heard of before

248
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.634
makes pitches

249
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.634
to people with money.

250
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:53.015
And their business model

251
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:53.015
was kind of simplicity itself.

252
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.601
Roddy: They'd have

253
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.601
a three-day extravaganza--

254
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.938
100, 150 companies--

255
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.938
and these CEOs would be saying,

256
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.607
"For these six or seven

257
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.607
or eight or ten reasons,

258
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.153
we think we're gonna

259
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.153
grow revenues 75 percent

260
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.153
next year."

261
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:08.155
Dan: China has gone,

262
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:08.155
in the last few years,

263
00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:09.698
from interesting to important.

264
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.076
And then it turns

265
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.076
into entertainment time.

266
00:08:12.243 --> 00:08:14.119
(crowd cheering)

267
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.872
Matt: Snoop Dogg, Billy Idol,

268
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.872
dancers,

269
00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:19.458
ice sculptures,

270
00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:19.458
Trojan theme night, buses,

271
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.461
trains, planes--

272
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.461
and then baijiu,

273
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.629
which looks like motor oil

274
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.629
in a can.

275
00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:25.756
You drank and you drank.

276
00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:30.428
You ganbei,

277
00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:30.428
you cheers to somebody,

278
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.221
and then they have

279
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.221
to cheers to somebody else,

280
00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:33.638
and it goes on and on and on.

281
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:34.932
The Chinese wanted to see

282
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.434
what kind of a person

283
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.434
you were,

284
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:39.644
and some of them felt like

285
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:39.644
the more drunk you got,

286
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.856
the more of your natural persona

287
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.856
would come out.

288
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.527
Narrator:

289
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.527
The master of ceremonies

290
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.780
at these conferences

291
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.780
was often the bank's

292
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:52.699
stage-diving chairman,

293
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:52.699
Byron Roth.

294
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.911
♪ I wanna rock and roll

295
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.911
All night ♪

296
00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:57.413
Performer: Get him up!

297
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.748
♪ And party every day,

298
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.748
I wanna rock and roll ♪

299
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.541
Roddy: You know, this is a guy

300
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.541
who started out

301
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.044
in the commodities business

302
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.044
when he was 16 years old.

303
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.338
His dad

304
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.338
had a feedlot business,

305
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.590
and they'd bid on cows at

306
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.590
auctions and stuff like that.

307
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.717
I mean, this is not

308
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.717
an unsophisticated man.

309
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.304
We just do things that are--

310
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.304
that are different.

311
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.721
And that's kind of

312
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.721
the way we are

313
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:15.931
as an investment banking firm.

314
00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:17.641
(crowd cheering)

315
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:19.935
Narrator: For Byron Roth

316
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:19.935
and Matt and Dan,

317
00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:21.353
it was time to party.

318
00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:26.317
Between 2006 and 2011,

319
00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:26.317
Roth hosted over a dozen

320
00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:29.320
conferences and raised

321
00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:29.320
billions for Chinese companies.

322
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:31.447
Performer:

323
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.031
(rock music playing)

324
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:39.579
- Performer: Whoo!

325
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:39.579
- (cheers and applause)

326
00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:45.085
(traffic humming)

327
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.711
Narrator:

328
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.711
Roth wasn't the only bank

329
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.297
cashing in on the China boom.

330
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.799
In New York, a small operator

331
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:53.552
named Rodman & Renshaw

332
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:53.552
ran investment conferences

333
00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.095
with a slightly different feel,

334
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.097
centered

335
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.097
on the political star power

336
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.599
of its chairman,

337
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.599
General Wesley Clark.

338
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.145
Male Announcer: In the Balkans,

339
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.145
he helped negotiate a peace

340
00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:04.604
between bitter enemies

341
00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.898
and led a multinational force

342
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.109
that stopped

343
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.109
a campaign of terror.

344
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:12.112
Wes Clark's life is simply

345
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:12.112
an American story,

346
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:13.738
but he will make

347
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.949
an extraordinary

348
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.949
American president.

349
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.621
Man: First I want to ask you

350
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.621
to just tell us who you are,

351
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.290
and tell me a bit

352
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.290
about your background.

353
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.000
Yeah, I'm retired general

354
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.000
Wes Clark.

355
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.836
Graduated from West Point

356
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.836
in 1966.

357
00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.506
Went to Oxford, went to Vietnam,

358
00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.506
came home on a stretcher.

359
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.466
Signed as a NATO

360
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.466
Supreme Allied Commander.

361
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.260
I ran for president

362
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.260
in 2003, 2004.

363
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.845
Went into investment banking.

364
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.016
Narrator: Rodman & Renshaw

365
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.016
had a troubled past.

366
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.768
After years

367
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.768
of management turmoil,

368
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.937
they declared bankruptcy

369
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.937
in the late '90s.

370
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:48.148
But with a luminary

371
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:48.148
like General Clark

372
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.192
as their public face,

373
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.192
they'd reemerged

374
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.776
as a respectable-looking bank,

375
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.279
hosting parties

376
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.279
and selling Chinese stock.

377
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.115
They would typically invite

378
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.115
presidents,

379
00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.702
ex-presidents, Colin Powell,

380
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.497
Diana Ross, Henry Kissinger.

381
00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:05.749
Roddy: For an hour or two,

382
00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:05.749
having Henry Kissinger

383
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.252
or George Bush

384
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.252
or Wesley Clark speak--

385
00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.212
boy, oh, boy,

386
00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.212
like you're going into

387
00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:13.131
some inner sanctum of knowledge,

388
00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:13.131
when, you know,

389
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.175
Kissinger's 90 years old,

390
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.175
talking out his ass.

391
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.594
You can see

392
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.594
what's happening there.

393
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.512
They're renting a name

394
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.512
for an hour or two.

395
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.598
Wesley: These people all work

396
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.598
for fees.

397
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.182
That's how they make money.

398
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.017
When luminaries speak at it,

399
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.644
more power to 'em.

400
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.188
Narrator: During the six years

401
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.188
that General Clark

402
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.188
was chairman,

403
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.774
Rodman & Renshaw brought

404
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.774
over 40 Chinese companies

405
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.235
to U.S. markets,

406
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.235
with an aggregate value

407
00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:35.613
of over $31 billion.

408
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:41.577
Narrator: While Rodman and Roth

409
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:41.577
made fees

410
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.579
for bringing Chinese companies

411
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.579
to the U.S.,

412
00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.163
the real paydays came

413
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.417
when the companies listed

414
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.417
on major stock exchanges

415
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.920
Their analysts would

416
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.920
recommend the risky stocks

417
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.548
as great investments,

418
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.548
and then their salesmen--

419
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.717
like Matt, would push them

420
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.717
on their investment network.

421
00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.804
(tickers clicking)

422
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.641
Narrator: Once the stocks rose

423
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.641
high enough,

424
00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.725
the banks and insiders

425
00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.725
could cash out,

426
00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.852
leaving others holding

427
00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.852
the overvalued shares.

428
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.939
The catch was,

429
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.939
listing a company

430
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.317
on the stock exchange

431
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.317
normally required audits

432
00:12:13.484 --> 00:12:14.652
and public vetting,

433
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.195
but the banks found a way

434
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.195
around all that.

435
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.865
They used a backdoor process

436
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.865
called a reverse merger.

437
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.868
It's dollar denominated.

438
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.868
It trades onshore,

439
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.996
the New York Stock Exchange,

440
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.996
the NASDAQ.

441
00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:28.332
It's normally a shell company

442
00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:30.959
that is a public-traded stock

443
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.337
that has no operations

444
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.337
underneath it.

445
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.630
You need to go to Nevada.

446
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.214
A lot of them were there,

447
00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.049
that had started off as

448
00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.049
mining companies or whatever,

449
00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.885
and they were just sort of

450
00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.885
sitting there, waiting,

451
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.139
you know, to find

452
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.139
the right partner

453
00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.474
who could merge into them.

454
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.391
So you need the shell company.

455
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.810
Narrator: Here's how

456
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.810
these reverse mergers work.

457
00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:50.937
a Chinese company

458
00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:50.937
looking for a way

459
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.565
into American exchanges

460
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.565
merges with the shell

461
00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.067
of a defunct U.S. company

462
00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.067
that no longer operates

463
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.612
but still legally exists

464
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.612
and has a listing

465
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.197
on a U.S. stock exchange.

466
00:13:00.656 --> 00:13:01.823
The Chinese company then takes

467
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.034
the shell company's place

468
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.034
in the market.

469
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.703
Presto! You just appear.

470
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.746
You're a stock

471
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.746
that's trading in the U.S.,

472
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.456
and you've got a story to tell.

473
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:11.124
And no one asks any questions.

474
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.793
(applause)

475
00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.673
Narrator: Between 2006 and 2012,

476
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.009
over 400 Chinese companies

477
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.009
listed on U.S. markets.

478
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.095
80 percent of them

479
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.095
were reverse mergers.

480
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.265
Our exchanges

481
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.265
are monitoring them.

482
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.477
Our banks are vetting

483
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.477
these companies.

484
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.062
You don't have

485
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.062
to worry about them

486
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:33.897
because they're

487
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:33.897
on the U.S. exchanges.

488
00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:42.573
Dan: Oh, you're in Hong Kong?

489
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:45.283
Late on the 30th.

490
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.413
Dan: Between 2009 and mid-2010,

491
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.832
the average China-based

492
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.832
reverse merger

493
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.670
was up several hundred percent--

494
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.670
the average!

495
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.838
Could you tell me

496
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.838
what China did last night?

497
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.592
We stuck with

498
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.592
our value-investing approach.

499
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.011
And with that approach

500
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.011
and with our guidelines,

501
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:08.348
that took us to a lot

502
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:08.348
of China-based companies.

503
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.225
And we made

504
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.225
several hundred percent

505
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:11.560
on all of 'em.

506
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.689
Longwei Petroleum,

507
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.689
bought them, $1, $1.50.

508
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.191
We sold, $5, $6,

509
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.191
500 percent profit.

510
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.943
L&L Energy,

511
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.571
bought them for under $2,

512
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.571
sold it between $9 and $10.

513
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.782
Puda Coal, bought them

514
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.782
for around $4,

515
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:26.366
sold them for around $7,

516
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:26.366
great company.

517
00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.702
China Agriculture, CAGC.

518
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.454
$9, sold them at $28.

519
00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:31.913
All great companies.

520
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.793
We were back.

521
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:50.724
Narrator: By 2010,

522
00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.184
Dan and the guys

523
00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.184
at Roth and Rodman

524
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.312
were making a killing

525
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.312
on the China stocks.

526
00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:59.399
It seemed like

527
00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:59.399
it would never end,

528
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.443
and maybe it wouldn't have,

529
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.443
had it not been

530
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.779
for one earnest young

531
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.779
American businessman

532
00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.071
who'd gone to Shanghai to seek

533
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.031
a completely different

534
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.031
type of fortune.

535
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.662
Carson: The business I set up

536
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:13.413
was the first

537
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:13.413
self-storage business

538
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.832
in mainland China.

539
00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.958
It was called

540
00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.958
Love Box Self Storage.

541
00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:18.669
World-class.

542
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.879
And we did win an award

543
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.173
for self-storage facility

544
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.173
of the year.

545
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.175
On the way to setting up

546
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.175
that business,

547
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.761
I co-authored "Doing Business

548
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.761
in China For Dummies."

549
00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.350
Narrator: Carson's father,

550
00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.350
a stockbroker back in the U.S.,

551
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.435
wanted to invest

552
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.435
in Orient Paper,

553
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.813
a company that Roth Capital

554
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.813
had brought to the markets

555
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.481
through a reverse merger.

556
00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:42.484
The company claimed that

557
00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:42.484
it was doing $100 million

558
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.820
in business a year

559
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.820
and shipping tons

560
00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.905
of high-quality paper

561
00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.905
all over China.

562
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.282
It was one of

563
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.282
the fast-growing companies

564
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:50.784
that Roth and Rodman had sold

565
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.952
and that investors

566
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.952
like Dan had bought.

567
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.497
Richard: The goal was

568
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.497
to do some research,

569
00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:57.081
make sure that it was legit.

570
00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.209
His father would

571
00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.209
write up the report.

572
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.461
Again, a fairly easy

573
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.461
to understand

574
00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.838
and analyze business

575
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.299
the opposite of

576
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.299
an American software company.

577
00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.968
Narrator: Carson and a friend

578
00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.968
went to check out the factory,

579
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.221
but right away,

580
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.221
something seemed off.

581
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.182
Carson: It was a country road.

582
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.182
It was in poor shape.

583
00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:18.269
That road could not support

584
00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:18.269
the massive trucks

585
00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:21.690
that would be going in and out

586
00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:21.690
of that facility all day.

587
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:23.817
Then we got into the factory.

588
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.986
(indistinct chatter)

589
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.865
Roddy: It was a complete dump.

590
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.992
Half the machines were broken,

591
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.992
weren't working.

592
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.287
Garbage rotting

593
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.287
out in the front yard,

594
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.539
no signage.

595
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.917
And this is their main

596
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.917
manufacturing facility.

597
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.501
There's water everywhere,

598
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.501
all right?

599
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.461
This is a company

600
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.461
that's a paper company.

601
00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.715
Carson: The company had just

602
00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.715
claimed to have clocked in

603
00:16:46.882 --> 00:16:48.592
$100 million U.S. in revenue,

604
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.969
which was up substantially

605
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.969
from the year before.

606
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.471
How was this growing

607
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.471
50 percent a year?

608
00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.557
On the balance sheet,

609
00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.557
they were showing about...

610
00:16:55.933 --> 00:16:58.769
$5 million in raw materials.

611
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.020
Carson: And so they had

612
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.020
heaps and heaps

613
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.815
of this old corrugated

614
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.815
cardboard out front.

615
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.984
Carson: My friend climbed

616
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.984
one of those heaps

617
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.613
to take a look at the expanse

618
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.613
of rotting cardboard,

619
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.615
and when he came down,

620
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.615
he said,

621
00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.867
"If this is worth $5 million,

622
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.286
the world's a much richer place

623
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.286
than I knew."

624
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.038
Carson and his dad looked

625
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.038
at each other at that point

626
00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:23.376
ah, and said, "There's probably

627
00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:23.376
something to do in this stock,

628
00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:25.169
but it has nothing to do

629
00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:25.169
with owning it."

630
00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:28.966
(camera shutter clicking,

631
00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:28.966
flashbulb whining)

632
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.641
Carson: This business

633
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.641
was a complete sham.

634
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.226
This is going to zero.

635
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.226
It's a total fraud.

636
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.979
I've never seen

637
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.979
anything like this.

638
00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:44.648
Narrator: Carson wrote a report

639
00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:44.648
of his findings

640
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.900
and announced that he was

641
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.900
going to back his claims

642
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.401
by making a bet in the market

643
00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.945
that the stock would collapse.

644
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.447
It would change

645
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.447
the course of his life,

646
00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.116
but more importantly,

647
00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.116
it was the first time

648
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.410
anyone had poked a hole

649
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.410
in the Chinese miracle.

650
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.788
Carson:

651
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.788
I sent it out into the ether

652
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.999
in late June of 2010.

653
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.459
I stayed up for a little bit

654
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.459
to watch it close,

655
00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.294
and going into the close,

656
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.421
it just moved down a little bit.

657
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.381
And so as I went to sleep,

658
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.217
I wondered whether that was

659
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.217
a reaction to the report.

660
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.679
Well, the next day

661
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.679
answered the question

662
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:17.597
down 25 percent.

663
00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.641
And it ended up trading down

664
00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.267
as much as 55 percent

665
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.353
from where

666
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.353
we had put out the report.

667
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.647
Even though it's China

668
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.647
and it's a fast-growing economy,

669
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.566
pigs do not fly in China,

670
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.566
and I think that...

671
00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.652
Carson:

672
00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.652
There's a proverb in Chinese,

673
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.488
"Muddy waters makes it

674
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.488
easy to catch fish."

675
00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:40.954
(speaking Mandarin)

676
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.456
(in English)

677
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.456
Yeah, so it means water.

678
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.544
Huh.

679
00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.838
That saying,

680
00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.838
"Muddy waters makes it easy

681
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.798
to catch fish,"

682
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.798
explains so much

683
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.341
about what goes on

684
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.341
in China.

685
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.638
Carson:

686
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.638
Opacity creates opportunities

687
00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.223
for people to make money.

688
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.019
That's China's view,

689
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.019
muddy waters.

690
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.979
I thought that

691
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.979
that was a very apropos name

692
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.272
for the firm and chose it.

693
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.320
(waves crashing,

694
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.320
seagulls screeching)

695
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.199
Narrator:

696
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.199
The "Muddy Waters Report"

697
00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.826
was the first major claim

698
00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.037
against a Chinese company,

699
00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.037
and it began to resonate

700
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.371
throughout the industry

701
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.124
nowhere more so

702
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.124
than at Roth Capital,

703
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.584
who'd engineered the deal.

704
00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.504
Target price,

705
00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.504
less than a dollar.

706
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.049
You have pictures

707
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.049
of dirty factories.

708
00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.259
You have pictures

709
00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.259
of recycled paper on the ground.

710
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.345
You have people climbing...

711
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.345
pictures.

712
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.182
This is a $150-million company.

713
00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.353
It's pretty crazy though.

714
00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.942
Matt: I had sold

715
00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.942
over $22 million of that deal.

716
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.407
Matt: I remember

717
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.407
going into Byron's office,

718
00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:00.658
asking, "What's going on here?"

719
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.121
Narrator: What was "going on"

720
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.121
was that the company

721
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.915
had deployed a classic move

722
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.915
in the reverse-merger playbook:

723
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.709
get a stamp of approval

724
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.709
from a trusted source.

725
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.586
Deloitte and Touche

726
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.586
had come out

727
00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.171
with an independent

728
00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.171
investigation saying

729
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.214
that the company was

730
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.214
accurately telling

731
00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:16.674
about its financial statements.

732
00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.217
Narrator:

733
00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.217
In the mortgage crisis,

734
00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:19.844
banks used rating agencies

735
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.679
to disguise

736
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.679
crappy mortgage bonds.

737
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.099
Now Orient Paper was using

738
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.850
an even more

739
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.850
recognizable cover

740
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.436
one of the Big Four

741
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.436
global audit firms.

742
00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.356
Every day,

743
00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.356
all around the world,

744
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.734
Deloitte professionals are

745
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.734
making an impact that matters...

746
00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:36.153
Narrator:

747
00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:36.153
It turns out that dozens

748
00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.612
of Chinese reverse mergers

749
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.823
used the same trick

750
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.823
hiding shady financials

751
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.825
behind audits

752
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.825
from the Big Four.

753
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.661
It was like handing investors

754
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.661
a shiny, thin file

755
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.287
- stamped, "Trust me."

756
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.287
- (bell dings)

757
00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.373
Because when it comes

758
00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.373
to living our purpose,

759
00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.250
it all starts with integrity.

760
00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.339
Carson: Whether it's Deloitte

761
00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.339
or PwC,

762
00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.551
they expect these brands

763
00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.551
to have significant value

764
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:03.930
wherever they are in the world,

765
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:03.930
but in actuality,

766
00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.974
the way these partnerships

767
00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.974
are structured

768
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:10.145
is that each office

769
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:10.145
is its own entity.

770
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.980
Roddy: So they were able

771
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.980
to dollarize

772
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.315
renting their name out,

773
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.315
effectively.

774
00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.526
All they hoped was that

775
00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.526
this company didn't collapse.

776
00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.903
(indistinct chatter)

777
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.072
Many of these companies

778
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.072
would say, "Well, look.

779
00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.740
We're being audited

780
00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.740
by Pricewaterhouse."

781
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.367
No, they're not.

782
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.911
They're being audited

783
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.911
by Pricewaterhouse China,

784
00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:28.621
which is like a franchise.

785
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.581
It's not really

786
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.581
Pricewaterhouse.

787
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.710
(siren wailing,

788
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.710
indistinct chatter)

789
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.628
Jim: In the United States,

790
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.628
whenever we've had

791
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.173
a massive fraud--

792
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.173
that we've been short

793
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.508
people always ask me,

794
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.508
"Well, who were the auditors?"

795
00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:42.510
And I always say,

796
00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:42.510
"Who cares?"

797
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.097
Jim:

798
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.097
It's important to understand,

799
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:47.849
and most people

800
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:47.849
don't know this,

801
00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.351
that the financial statements

802
00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.351
are prepared by management,

803
00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:51.853
not by the auditors.

804
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.730
(siren wailing)

805
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:57.316
Jim: Auditor's job is to simply

806
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:57.316
review management's work.

807
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.070
And if management is trying

808
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.070
to hide something

809
00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:03.198
or has co-opted the auditors,

810
00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:03.198
they will hide it.

811
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:05.783
Narrator:

812
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:05.783
If hiding it doesn't work,

813
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.118
they opt for plan B.

814
00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:08.828
hire a good lawyer.

815
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.540
Orient Paper brought in

816
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.540
Mitch Nussbaum of Loeb & Loeb

817
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.918
to respond

818
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.918
to Muddy Waters' allegations.

819
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.588
Mitch had helped bring dozens

820
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.588
of Chinese companies to market,

821
00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:20.006
and he knew how to fight back.

822
00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.259
You have short sellers who--

823
00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.259
who go ahead

824
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.885
and put a short position

825
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.885
on the company

826
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.512
and then throw all sorts

827
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.512
of allegations against them...

828
00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.723
Narrator: Nussbaum's firm

829
00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.723
led an investigation.

830
00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:30.600
His unsurprising conclusion

831
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.560
was that Carson's allegations

832
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.560
were false

833
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.938
and that his report

834
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.938
amounted to slander.

835
00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:37.023
How-- do I know what anybody's

836
00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:37.023
telling me is true?

837
00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:38.775
- Host: That's a huge problem.

838
00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:38.775
- It's a huge problem.

839
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.277
Host: All right,

840
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:43.113
Man: Let's talk about

841
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:43.113
a case where you did a type

842
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.281
of forensic investigation--

843
00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:45.656
- um hmm.

844
00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:45.656
- Producer: Orient Paper.

845
00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:48.367
I wouldn't be prepared

846
00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:48.367
in these circumstances

847
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:51.329
to discuss or present any more

848
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:51.329
or additional information

849
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.581
than what we disclosed publicly,

850
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.581
because that wouldn't be,

851
00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.208
you know, appropriate.

852
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.423
Narrator: The Chinese businesses

853
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.423
were a huge profit center

854
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.466
for Loeb & Loeb,

855
00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:05.843
but I imagined

856
00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:05.843
that the company's

857
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.386
often-shoddy paperwork

858
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:09.097
posed a problem for Nussbaum

859
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:09.097
and his colleagues.

860
00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.558
I wondered how just how much

861
00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.558
diligence they had to do

862
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.144
to satisfy regulators.

863
00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:17.272
Forget about the lawyer.

864
00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:17.272
Forget about the banker.

865
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.065
The banker doesn't go

866
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.065
into the books

867
00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:20.317
and records of the company.

868
00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:21.609
The lawyers don't go

869
00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:21.609
into the books

870
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:22.860
and records of the companies.

871
00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:25.446
We don't go check

872
00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:25.446
to see whether

873
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.157
the shipments were received.

874
00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.617
You know, we don't go visit

875
00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.617
the customers' homes.

876
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:31.577
I mean, no law firm does this.

877
00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:33.246
No law firm does this.

878
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.789
Narrator:

879
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.789
This is the part of the story

880
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.124
where I had to do

881
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.124
a double take.

882
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.210
All of the people who

883
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.210
we think of as gatekeepers,

884
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.296
the lawyers,

885
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.296
the bankers, the auditors,

886
00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:43.173
the people making good money

887
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.841
to ensure that

888
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.841
the markets are clean,

889
00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:46.968
weren't doing

890
00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:46.968
anything of the sort.

891
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:50.013
They simply processed

892
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:50.013
the necessary paperwork,

893
00:23:50.263 --> 00:23:51.889
took their fees, and moved on.

894
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.642
If the companies were lying,

895
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.642
so what?

896
00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:57.436
(thunder rumbling,

897
00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:57.436
rain pattering)

898
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.482
The answers

899
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.482
that I was receiving

900
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:06.029
was insufficient

901
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:06.029
to thwart my concerns.

902
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.739
And I didn't feel they were

903
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.739
thorough enough

904
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.616
answers to questions.

905
00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:13.203
(thunder crashing)

906
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.453
Matt: And that's when

907
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.914
everything significantly

908
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.914
changed for me.

909
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:20.084
My eyes were open

910
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:20.084
to this concept

911
00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:23.462
that there was another side

912
00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:23.462
to this company.

913
00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:30.887
Matt: I knew what my job was.

914
00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:30.887
I knew what I couldn't do

915
00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:32.722
if I was sitting

916
00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:32.722
in that seat still.

917
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:35.599
So for me, it was... quit,

918
00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.436
go take a break,

919
00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.436
and see what happens.

920
00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:40.021
I went on safari.

921
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.032
I'm at a Rodman & Renshaw

922
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.032
conference,

923
00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:54.327
and a firm by the name

924
00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:54.327
of Muddy Waters

925
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.954
puts out a report

926
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.954
on Orient Paper,

927
00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.749
and it goes down significantly.

928
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.753
And this is the first time

929
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.753
that we're actually hearing

930
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.755
somebody's publishing a report

931
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.755
and calling it fraud.

932
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.883
Dan: We decided that

933
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.135
we were either good

934
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.135
at what we do

935
00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:15.098
or we were lucky,

936
00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:15.098
and if we were lucky,

937
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.807
we were about

938
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.807
to go out of business.

939
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.226
Chris: I'm trying to reach

940
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.226
either the general manager

941
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.310
or the property manager...

942
00:25:19.436 --> 00:25:20.519
Dan: So we hired our own team.

943
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.940
Dan:

944
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.940
And our own team went to China

945
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:27.485
to vet some of these companies

946
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:27.485
that were accused of fraud.

947
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:30.113
Man: Let's talk about

948
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:30.113
China Green Agriculture.

949
00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:32.156
China Green Agriculture

950
00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:32.156
came to our attention

951
00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:34.658
originally in 2009.

952
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.871
Dan: And we invested long

953
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.871
into what we thought was

954
00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:40.331
a great fertilizer company.

955
00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.417
Their stock was pumping.

956
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.920
Press releases were coming out

957
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.920
about deals they were making

958
00:25:46.087 --> 00:25:47.630
with Nestlé and whoever else.

959
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.757
Narrator: Dan calculated that

960
00:25:49.924 --> 00:25:51.468
in order

961
00:25:49.924 --> 00:25:51.468
to fulfill these contracts,

962
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.261
dozens of trucks

963
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.261
would have to be loading

964
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:55.138
and unloading goods all day.

965
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:58.641
So even though

966
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:58.641
monitoring private companies

967
00:25:58.808 --> 00:25:59.934
is illegal in China,

968
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:01.936
his team risked

969
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:01.936
lengthy jail terms

970
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:04.897
to set up surveillance cameras

971
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:04.897
outside the factory gates.

972
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:10.361
We filmed them for 344 days.

973
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.489
Tapes showed us

974
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.489
of very little activity going,

975
00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.240
very few employees

976
00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.240
coming in and out.

977
00:26:17.327 --> 00:26:18.786
Narrator: Dan figured that

978
00:26:17.327 --> 00:26:18.786
if the company was doing

979
00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:20.538
what it said it was,

980
00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:20.538
it would have

981
00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:23.124
hundreds of employees

982
00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:23.124
and dozens of drivers.

983
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.710
Dan: So what we do is,

984
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.710
we have our investigator

985
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:28.587
pose as a tea salesman.

986
00:26:29.672 --> 00:26:31.174
So he shows up,

987
00:26:29.672 --> 00:26:31.174
and he's got a suitcase

988
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:34.218
full of tea samples,

989
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:34.218
says he's a tea salesman

990
00:26:34.385 --> 00:26:37.263
and he wants to give

991
00:26:34.385 --> 00:26:37.263
free tea samples for everybody.

992
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:40.016
(in Mandarin)

993
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.775
Dan: So tell me how many

994
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.775
employees you have here

995
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:51.902
so I can give you

996
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:51.902
enough samples.

997
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:52.987
We get that answer.

998
00:26:53.154 --> 00:26:54.822
(in Mandarin)

999
00:26:56.199 --> 00:26:58.617
Man: What did it mean that

1000
00:26:56.199 --> 00:26:58.617
they only had one truck driver?

1001
00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:01.162
It meant that their volume

1002
00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:04.623
was vastly less

1003
00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:04.623
than they had claimed.

1004
00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:12.882
In the first half of this year,

1005
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.719
Ah, Yongye grew both revenues

1006
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.719
and net income by about

1007
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.719
100 percent.

1008
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.721
Narrator: Calling out

1009
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.721
China Green Agriculture meant

1010
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:20.848
that Dan was also questioning

1011
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:20.848
the integrity

1012
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.059
of some of the guys he'd ridden

1013
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.059
the China-stock wave up with.

1014
00:27:23.518 --> 00:27:24.935
guys like Crocker Coulson,

1015
00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:27.021
a stock promoter

1016
00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:27.021
who'd pushed this stock

1017
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:28.147
and dozens like it.

1018
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:31.067
What about, um,

1019
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:31.067
China Green Agriculture?

1020
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:34.862
Crocker: So that's another

1021
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:34.862
fertilizer story that we were...

1022
00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:38.074
Again, this kind of goes back

1023
00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:38.074
a fair ways for me.

1024
00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:39.283
- Yeah.

1025
00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:39.283
- I believe that was

1026
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:41.160
an organic fertilizer.

1027
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:42.537
It was also supposed to have...

1028
00:27:43.037 --> 00:27:44.247
um...

1029
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.457
I really don't remember

1030
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.457
a whole lot about that company.

1031
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:49.210
What we came up with is,

1032
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:49.210
they were doing 10 percent

1033
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:50.628
of the business

1034
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:50.628
that they claimed.

1035
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.046
And then the fight began.

1036
00:27:53.548 --> 00:27:56.509
Dan: Puts out a press release

1037
00:27:53.548 --> 00:27:56.509
calling us terrorists,

1038
00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:59.262
saboteurs, criminals.

1039
00:28:00.096 --> 00:28:02.557
There was a statement from

1040
00:28:00.096 --> 00:28:02.557
five Beijing finance professors

1041
00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:04.601
who alleged

1042
00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:04.601
wealthy and sophisticated

1043
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:05.976
short sellers from overseas

1044
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:07.811
were robbing

1045
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:07.811
small Chinese investors

1046
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.981
and ignoring risks

1047
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.981
of market instability.

1048
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.525
They didn't cite any evidence.

1049
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:15.403
Just to be clear,

1050
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:15.403
we put a lot of effort

1051
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.280
into trying

1052
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.280
to weed out companies,

1053
00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:19.574
you know,

1054
00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:19.574
before representing them

1055
00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:21.909
and then to flag problems,

1056
00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.245
serious problems,

1057
00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.245
if we saw them.

1058
00:28:24.412 --> 00:28:25.580
There was no way to know

1059
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.415
which were the good actors

1060
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.415
and bad actors.

1061
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.711
A gate guard

1062
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.711
knows what's happening.

1063
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.880
(seagulls screeching)

1064
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.216
Dan: So we went

1065
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.216
to the investment banks.

1066
00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:40.094
We took them our evidence.

1067
00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:40.094
We said, "Look what we found.

1068
00:28:41.095 --> 00:28:43.180
If you hire us and our team

1069
00:28:41.095 --> 00:28:43.180
to do diligence,

1070
00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:44.641
you'll have a better product

1071
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:45.933
to sell to

1072
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:45.933
the American people."

1073
00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:48.185
They said, "Get out of here.

1074
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:52.815
You're telling us to pay you

1075
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:52.815
not to collect 10 percent fees

1076
00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:54.900
on every transaction

1077
00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:54.900
done through this bank.

1078
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.946
The less we know, the better,

1079
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.946
and by the way,

1080
00:28:59.113 --> 00:29:00.739
if you tell anybody

1081
00:28:59.113 --> 00:29:00.739
what you found, we'll sue you.

1082
00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:03.242
Go back to Skippack."

1083
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:06.787
So we went back to Skippack.

1084
00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:09.415
We published our research.

1085
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.252
Narrator: Dan's report laid out

1086
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:13.252
his allegations

1087
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.212
against China

1088
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.212
Green Agriculture.

1089
00:29:16.005 --> 00:29:18.215
Dan: The stock trades

1090
00:29:16.005 --> 00:29:18.215
for a dollar today.

1091
00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:21.927
You know, it turns out

1092
00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:21.927
nobody believes them.

1093
00:29:23.012 --> 00:29:24.347
Man: What happened

1094
00:29:23.012 --> 00:29:24.347
to the chairman?

1095
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.766
Nothing.

1096
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.766
I mean, he's kept the money.

1097
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.436
And that's what this

1098
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.436
is all about, right?

1099
00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:34.190
That's $113 million that has

1100
00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:34.190
just, poof, vanished

1101
00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:37.776
Ah, because they never really

1102
00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:37.776
did that kind of volume.

1103
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.281
Narrator: Dan realized he'd made

1104
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.281
money off of companies' lies,

1105
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.824
and it gnawed at him,

1106
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.868
because he knew he'd crossed

1107
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.496
into what a lot of people see

1108
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.496
as the dark side of finance--

1109
00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:49.830
short selling.

1110
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:56.128
(jingle playing)

1111
00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:58.172
Herb: What is short selling?

1112
00:29:58.422 --> 00:29:59.549
Hmm, let me think about this.

1113
00:29:59.716 --> 00:30:01.342
I want to-- this is always

1114
00:29:59.716 --> 00:30:01.342
a difficult one.

1115
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:02.968
But short-- (chuckles)

1116
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.012
What is-- (chuckling)

1117
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.972
Well, the first short

1118
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.972
economically

1119
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:09.767
was probably some transaction

1120
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:09.767
between, you know,

1121
00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.435
two Cro-Magnon person,

1122
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:14.480
promising some guy--

1123
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:14.480
some other Cro-Magnon

1124
00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:15.690
part of a saber-tooth tiger.

1125
00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:17.525
Narrator: This is Jim Chanos.

1126
00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:18.817
He's the dean of short sellers.

1127
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.363
And he's brought down some of

1128
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.363
the biggest frauds in history.

1129
00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:24.615
If you want to think

1130
00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:24.615
about short selling,

1131
00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:27.117
all kinds of commercial

1132
00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:27.117
transactions are short selling.

1133
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:29.704
An airline that sells you

1134
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:29.704
an advance-purchase ticket,

1135
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.206
for example,

1136
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.206
is shorting you a seat.

1137
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:35.251
Short selling is betting

1138
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:35.251
that a stock is gonna go down,

1139
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.586
as opposed to go up.

1140
00:30:36.794 --> 00:30:38.128
So shorting a stock,

1141
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:41.131
you'll often hear it referred to

1142
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:41.131
as "borrowing shares."

1143
00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:43.342
Narrator: This is where

1144
00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:43.342
a lot of people get confused.

1145
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.843
Here's a simple way

1146
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.843
to think of it.

1147
00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.680
Narrator:

1148
00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.680
Say I want to short sugar.

1149
00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.057
I think that sugar

1150
00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.057
is overvalued

1151
00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:52.476
and it's going to cost less

1152
00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:52.476
in, say, six months

1153
00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:53.936
than it does today.

1154
00:30:54.687 --> 00:30:55.979
I see a business opportunity.

1155
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:59.149
I go to my neighbor

1156
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:59.149
and borrow one pound of sugar.

1157
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:01.402
Then I turn right around

1158
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:01.402
and sell that sugar

1159
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:03.279
for the going rate

1160
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:03.279
of $1 a pound.

1161
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:04.488
Manly Voice: Yeah!

1162
00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:05.989
Narrator: In about six months,

1163
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:08.242
when I have to give my neighbor

1164
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:08.242
a pound of sugar back,

1165
00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:11.912
I go buy it on the open market,

1166
00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:11.912
where the price has come down,

1167
00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:13.956
and it only costs me 50 cents.

1168
00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:15.874
I give my neighbor

1169
00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:15.874
a pound of sugar back,

1170
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:17.627
plus a little extra

1171
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:17.627
for interest,

1172
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:20.087
and pocket

1173
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:20.087
the 50-cent difference.

1174
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.507
She's got her sugar back,

1175
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.507
and I've made money on my bet.

1176
00:31:24.258 --> 00:31:26.969
You want everybody else

1177
00:31:24.258 --> 00:31:26.969
who's trading in that stock

1178
00:31:27.136 --> 00:31:29.305
to believe what you're saying

1179
00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:31.390
if you think that

1180
00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:31.390
the company is a fraud

1181
00:31:31.557 --> 00:31:34.059
or you think that something

1182
00:31:31.557 --> 00:31:34.059
about the company is not true.

1183
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.312
The person that's most

1184
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.312
attracted to short selling

1185
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.897
is probably those who've been

1186
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.897
dropped on their heads at birth.

1187
00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:40.817
They're iconoclasts.

1188
00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:42.652
Do I believe that their

1189
00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:42.652
motivation was to--

1190
00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:44.695
was justice for the world?

1191
00:31:44.862 --> 00:31:46.947
No, I think their motivation

1192
00:31:44.862 --> 00:31:46.947
was to profit from this.

1193
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:49.158
It's about cleaning

1194
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:49.158
our financial markets.

1195
00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:50.534
It's about stopping a fraud.

1196
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:52.286
What I really want to do is,

1197
00:31:52.453 --> 00:31:53.579
I want to reach in...

1198
00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:55.832
Narrator: Remember this guy,

1199
00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:55.832
Dick Fuld?

1200
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:57.916
He ran Lehman Brothers,

1201
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:57.916
the bank whose collapse

1202
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.419
set off the financial crisis

1203
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.419
in 2008.

1204
00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:02.839
He's got an opinion

1205
00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:02.839
about short sellers.

1206
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:06.091
Rip out their heart,

1207
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:06.091
and eat it before they die.

1208
00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:07.844
(crowd laughing)

1209
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:09.970
Mitch: So there are

1210
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:09.970
a lot of problems here.

1211
00:32:10.137 --> 00:32:11.514
There are a lot

1212
00:32:10.137 --> 00:32:11.514
of problems here.

1213
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.433
Dan:

1214
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.433
When I bet against a company,

1215
00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:16.644
it's because I believe

1216
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:18.479
that they're misrepresenting.

1217
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.440
And their trend line

1218
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.440
doesn't matter to me at all.

1219
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.944
I am somebody that will

1220
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.944
bet against fraud.

1221
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.284
Narrator: As Dan and Carson

1222
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.284
began looking

1223
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.036
for other Chinese companies

1224
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.036
to short,

1225
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.539
Matt was just getting back

1226
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.539
from his safari.

1227
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.667
He'd been out of the loop

1228
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.667
and wanted to make sense

1229
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:40.835
of what he'd been a part of.

1230
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:42.837
So he asked his friend Soren,

1231
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.005
a finance industry lawyer

1232
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.005
from New York,

1233
00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:47.174
to meet him for a weekend

1234
00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:47.174
in the mountains

1235
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:48.843
and take a look

1236
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:48.843
at some of the documents

1237
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.636
he'd saved

1238
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.636
from his time at Roth.

1239
00:32:51.721 --> 00:32:54.056
In the process,

1240
00:32:51.721 --> 00:32:54.056
they would discover a new way

1241
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.974
to look at the whole

1242
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.974
landscape of fraud.

1243
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:59.562
Matt said,

1244
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:59.562
"Just look at these companies.

1245
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.104
Tell me what you think."

1246
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.572
L&L Energy was nominally

1247
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.572
a coal company.

1248
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.451
Soren:

1249
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.451
Very typical of an RTO fraud

1250
00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:16.704
in that

1251
00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:16.704
its financial performance

1252
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:18.205
was simply too good to be true.

1253
00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.709
(man speaking Mandarin)

1254
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:27.130
Soren: The notion

1255
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:27.130
that a small reverse merger

1256
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:29.884
from rural China could somehow

1257
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.887
efficiently mine

1258
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.887
and process coal

1259
00:33:33.387 --> 00:33:36.014
so much better than the best

1260
00:33:33.387 --> 00:33:36.014
coal companies in the world

1261
00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:37.808
was just not credible.

1262
00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:40.394
Narrator:

1263
00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:40.394
Digging into the papers,

1264
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:42.229
they uncovered a new way

1265
00:33:42.396 --> 00:33:44.273
to understand

1266
00:33:42.396 --> 00:33:44.273
what was really going on

1267
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.816
with the hundreds

1268
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.816
of Chinese companies

1269
00:33:45.983 --> 00:33:47.818
listed on U.S. exchanges.

1270
00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:51.572
What we came back with were

1271
00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:51.572
what are called SAIC filings.

1272
00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.825
They're these filings

1273
00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.825
from the State Office of, uh...

1274
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.327
Oh, my gosh, can't believe

1275
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.327
I'm blanking on this.

1276
00:33:57.912 --> 00:34:00.205
State Office of, uh, Adminis--

1277
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:02.291
State Administrative Office.

1278
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:02.291
Is that right?

1279
00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.752
Richard: The interesting part

1280
00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.752
here was that

1281
00:34:05.127 --> 00:34:09.256
the filings in China

1282
00:34:05.127 --> 00:34:09.256
tended to be very accurate

1283
00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:13.469
or more accurate than

1284
00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:13.469
the fictions that were filed

1285
00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:15.554
with the Securities

1286
00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:15.554
and Exchange Commission.

1287
00:34:16.597 --> 00:34:19.099
Narrator: In China,

1288
00:34:16.597 --> 00:34:19.099
a company might accurately say

1289
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:21.518
they made $10 million,

1290
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:21.518
while in the U.S.,

1291
00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:24.062
they could report

1292
00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:24.062
making $100 million or more.

1293
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.983
These SAIC filings

1294
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.983
were dead reliable.

1295
00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:29.359
They showed exactly

1296
00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:29.359
what was going on.

1297
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.194
(crows cawing)

1298
00:34:32.863 --> 00:34:34.865
Dan: And this is-- this is

1299
00:34:32.863 --> 00:34:34.865
the cultural difference,

1300
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:40.704
we can't find auditors

1301
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:40.704
in China that will help us,

1302
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.080
because let me

1303
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.080
tell you something,

1304
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.541
if we do find those people,

1305
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.085
the government of China

1306
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.085
will kill 'em.

1307
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.005
I mean, they will take

1308
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.005
their ass out

1309
00:34:49.338 --> 00:34:51.089
and shoot them

1310
00:34:49.338 --> 00:34:51.089
in the fucking head.

1311
00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:54.927
Soren: This was, from the

1312
00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:54.927
beginning, a deception.

1313
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:58.096
The purpose of it

1314
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:58.096
was to deceive,

1315
00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:00.516
from day one, and we'd

1316
00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:00.516
never really seen that

1317
00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:03.352
at this scale

1318
00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:03.352
in the United States market.

1319
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.437
And that's probably why

1320
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.437
it took everyone by surprise.

1321
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.817
Narrator: That included Matt,

1322
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.817
and his reaction was telling,

1323
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:12.569
maybe it says something

1324
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:12.569
about human nature,

1325
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:15.113
about why we keep getting

1326
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:15.113
into these messes.

1327
00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:18.408
He realized that hundreds

1328
00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:18.408
of millions of dollars

1329
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.786
in Chinese reverse mergers

1330
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.786
that he'd sold were frauds,

1331
00:35:21.704 --> 00:35:24.999
but he didn't react

1332
00:35:21.704 --> 00:35:24.999
with shame, just pragmatism.

1333
00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:28.126
He wanted to make sure he got

1334
00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:28.126
a piece of the ride down,

1335
00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:30.128
so he switched sides

1336
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:32.297
and became a short seller,

1337
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:32.297
like Dan.

1338
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.136
I-- I did it

1339
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.136
and made 78 percent in...

1340
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:40.305
four days.

1341
00:35:46.979 --> 00:35:49.147
Eventually LLEN collapsed.

1342
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:51.734
Narrator: For short sellers

1343
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:51.734
like Dan and Matt,

1344
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:53.736
the filings were the final

1345
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:53.736
piece of the puzzle--

1346
00:35:54.528 --> 00:35:56.655
not just evidence

1347
00:35:54.528 --> 00:35:56.655
from one company or another

1348
00:35:57.197 --> 00:35:58.782
but data from

1349
00:35:57.197 --> 00:35:58.782
all the companies.

1350
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.035
For the first time,

1351
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.035
they could see

1352
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.745
the full scope

1353
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.745
of the deception.

1354
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.122
Carson: I don't know

1355
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.122
what the numbers are,

1356
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.874
but it's well into

1357
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.874
the billions of dollars

1358
00:36:07.041 --> 00:36:08.667
that U.S. investors have lost.

1359
00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:10.920
$30 billion, I think

1360
00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:10.920
the number was $30 billion.

1361
00:36:11.087 --> 00:36:12.379
- $20 billion.

1362
00:36:11.087 --> 00:36:12.379
- $50 billion.

1363
00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:14.464
It's between

1364
00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:14.464
$20 billion and $50 billion

1365
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:17.300
of market capitalization

1366
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:17.300
of stock that's listed

1367
00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:20.345
here in the United States

1368
00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:20.345
that might be worth zero.

1369
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:23.015
Individual

1370
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:23.015
mom-and-pop investors

1371
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:26.643
and mutual funds were invested

1372
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:26.643
in these Chinese companies,

1373
00:36:26.977 --> 00:36:29.187
so it really does affect

1374
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.189
the average person

1375
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.189
on the street as well.

1376
00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.570
Soren: If this one company

1377
00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.570
is so brazenly fraudulent,

1378
00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.949
what does that say

1379
00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.949
about the rest of the market?

1380
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:44.369
Soren:

1381
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:44.369
Over 300 reverse mergers

1382
00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:46.872
with businesses operating

1383
00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:46.872
in China.

1384
00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:50.500
This whole thing

1385
00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:50.500
could be fraudulent.

1386
00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:54.212
And that money

1387
00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:54.212
could never be recovered,

1388
00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:57.382
and if you got caught,

1389
00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:57.382
there was no consequences.

1390
00:36:58.508 --> 00:36:59.802
When you talk about

1391
00:36:58.508 --> 00:36:59.802
the investment banks,

1392
00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:01.095
especially the bigger ones,

1393
00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:05.682
fraud is baked

1394
00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:05.682
into the income statement.

1395
00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:08.144
How many investment banks

1396
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:12.355
have had to pay fines this year

1397
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:12.355
for fraud?

1398
00:37:13.899 --> 00:37:16.234
Wells Fargo? Check.

1399
00:37:16.986 --> 00:37:18.862
Bank of America has in the past.

1400
00:37:16.986 --> 00:37:18.862
Check.

1401
00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:20.948
Morgan Stanley has in the past.

1402
00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:20.948
Check.

1403
00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:23.533
Nobody's going to jail.

1404
00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:23.533
It's a fine.

1405
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.661
So it becomes part--

1406
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.288
it becomes part

1407
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.288
of what you budget.

1408
00:37:28.956 --> 00:37:30.415
You budget for fraud.

1409
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.542
(traffic whooshing)

1410
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.006
Narrator: Maybe Dan's fixation

1411
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.006
on fraud comes from the fact

1412
00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:39.175
that Flint, Michigan,

1413
00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:39.175
where he grew up,

1414
00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:41.426
is the victim

1415
00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:41.426
of a kind of fraud.

1416
00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:43.220
(train whistle blows)

1417
00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:46.389
Big companies made big promises

1418
00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:46.389
to the people who lived there,

1419
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.475
and in the end,

1420
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.475
they couldn't keep them.

1421
00:37:50.186 --> 00:37:53.189
Dan saw firsthand how lies

1422
00:37:50.186 --> 00:37:53.189
coming from corporate offices

1423
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.315
actually affect

1424
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.315
real people on the ground.

1425
00:37:56.733 --> 00:37:58.610
Where other finance guys

1426
00:37:56.733 --> 00:37:58.610
see market machinations,

1427
00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:00.654
Dan sees his hometown,

1428
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.991
busted, full of ghosts.

1429
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.296
Dan: This was a pretty nice area

1430
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.296
30 years ago.

1431
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:23.301
Hmm.

1432
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.309
Dan: This was a school.

1433
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:37.107
Dan: By today's standards,

1434
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:37.107
it was pretty violent.

1435
00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:42.821
I mean, I can't even imagine

1436
00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:42.821
10, 11, and 12-year-old kids

1437
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:44.823
swinging bats

1438
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:44.823
at each other today.

1439
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:54.875
No, I was definitely--

1440
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.543
I was happy growing up here,

1441
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.543
for sure.

1442
00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:04.134
Dan: Companies lie.

1443
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:07.345
Companies lie.

1444
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.561
Companies have companies'

1445
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.561
best interests at heart--

1446
00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:17.731
not a community's,

1447
00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:17.731
not a people's.

1448
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:21.359
The people need to have

1449
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:21.359
their own interests at heart.

1450
00:39:26.323 --> 00:39:27.407
Flint's an awesome town.

1451
00:39:27.991 --> 00:39:29.451
It's always been

1452
00:39:27.991 --> 00:39:29.451
an awesome town.

1453
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.122
Very hardworking community.

1454
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:36.083
Very hardworking community.

1455
00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:43.090
All right, look.

1456
00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:49.221
I saw myself growing up in Flint

1457
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.056
and staying there forever.

1458
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.935
And then the jobs were gone.

1459
00:39:57.813 --> 00:39:59.148
(thud)

1460
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:02.651
(wind blowing)

1461
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:07.447
Narrator: Dan had investigated

1462
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:07.447
the companies

1463
00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:08.615
from the ground up.

1464
00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:10.408
Matt had seen

1465
00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:10.408
the bird's-eye view

1466
00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:11.868
of their SEC filings.

1467
00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:14.246
Together they began to realize

1468
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:16.414
how shockingly simple

1469
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:16.414
the whole thing was.

1470
00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:20.085
Let's say that you wanted

1471
00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:20.085
to construct a fraud.

1472
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:24.965
Matt: What you would do is,

1473
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:24.965
you would have a factory.

1474
00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:26.091
You would have a chairman.

1475
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.344
And then you would find

1476
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.344
someone,

1477
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.761
a gatekeeper, for example.

1478
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:33.056
A finder says,

1479
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:33.056
"This is your business.

1480
00:40:33.807 --> 00:40:35.934
What could you do

1481
00:40:33.807 --> 00:40:35.934
with $100 million?"

1482
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.187
Matt: He would help with

1483
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.187
connections with auditors,

1484
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.189
legal tier-three banks.

1485
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.274
Dan: This operator in China

1486
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.274
would be like,

1487
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:45.027
"Well, that'd be--

1488
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:45.027
it would be a game changer."

1489
00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:47.279
"I'd buy up my competition.

1490
00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:47.279
I could do this.

1491
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.281
I could do that.

1492
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.281
I'd be this big."

1493
00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:50.573
Get to the United States.

1494
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.492
Dan: This guy or this company

1495
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.492
in China

1496
00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:54.536
would say,

1497
00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:54.536
"Okay, I'm gonna get you

1498
00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:57.497
a $100 million,

1499
00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:57.497
but this is what you have to do.

1500
00:40:57.873 --> 00:41:00.625
You have to tell people

1501
00:40:57.873 --> 00:41:00.625
that you're already this big."

1502
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:03.253
You just had to make sure

1503
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:03.253
that you checked all the boxes

1504
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.755
in order to get it to be sold.

1505
00:41:05.922 --> 00:41:08.466
Dan: And don't worry,

1506
00:41:05.922 --> 00:41:08.466
because if they even find out

1507
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:10.844
that we're lying,

1508
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:10.844
you won't go to jail.

1509
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.388
- You're in China."

1510
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.388
- All you needed was

1511
00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:13.847
the collusion

1512
00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:13.847
of a couple players,

1513
00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:15.432
and you could defraud

1514
00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:15.432
anyone you wanted.

1515
00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:16.975
Dan: And if we're lucky enough

1516
00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:16.975
to get the money

1517
00:41:17.142 --> 00:41:18.060
and they find out you're lying,

1518
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.311
you get to keep the money.

1519
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:22.231
So there's really no risk here.

1520
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:22.231
I'll do all the work.

1521
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:25.025
All you have to do

1522
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:25.025
is continue to tell the lie.

1523
00:41:25.234 --> 00:41:26.693
(money counter whirs)

1524
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.611
You know,

1525
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.611
if you're gonna be a CEO

1526
00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:30.488
of a public company,

1527
00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:30.488
you've got to be educated,

1528
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:35.160
gone to college, got an MBA.

1529
00:41:35.327 --> 00:41:37.454
These guys had zero of that.

1530
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.123
Zero, a lot of these guys.

1531
00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:43.460
They came from second,

1532
00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:43.460
third-tier cities in China.

1533
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.754
They came from a different way

1534
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.754
of doing business...

1535
00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.216
Like running

1536
00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.216
their own candy store

1537
00:41:49.383 --> 00:41:50.759
type of way doing business.

1538
00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:52.469
(chickens clucking)

1539
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:56.432
Dan: A Chinese chicken farmer

1540
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:56.432
does not wake up one day

1541
00:41:56.973 --> 00:42:01.103
and understand how to defraud

1542
00:41:56.973 --> 00:42:01.103
the U.S. capital markets.

1543
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.939
From the creation

1544
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.939
of these little companies,

1545
00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:06.442
it's all about

1546
00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:06.442
stock market fraud.

1547
00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:08.360
(applause and bell ringing)

1548
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.028
Narrator: Once Dan, Matt,

1549
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.028
and the other shorts

1550
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.072
figured out

1551
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.072
the basic characteristics

1552
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:15.409
of the China frauds,

1553
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:15.409
they started taking them out,

1554
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:15.409
one by one.

1555
00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:20.497
Puda Coal, the chairman,

1556
00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:20.497
stole investors' shares.

1557
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:23.500
SINO Clean Energy,

1558
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:23.500
super technology.

1559
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.502
This company puts advertisements

1560
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.502
on buses.

1561
00:42:26.336 --> 00:42:28.380
Dan: They would crush coal,

1562
00:42:26.336 --> 00:42:28.380
mix it with water,

1563
00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:31.508
and that was energy...

1564
00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:31.508
phenomenal.

1565
00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:36.305
They hired none other

1566
00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:36.305
than Loeb & Loeb to sue us.

1567
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.348
China Integrated Energy,

1568
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:42.018
for weeks and weeks and weeks,

1569
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:42.018
there was nothing happening

1570
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:42.018
at this company.

1571
00:42:42.394 --> 00:42:44.354
All of a sudden,

1572
00:42:42.394 --> 00:42:44.354
things get turned on.

1573
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.064
Lights start working.

1574
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.234
The next day,

1575
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.234
Rodman & Renshaw shows up

1576
00:42:49.443 --> 00:42:50.610
with a busload of investors.

1577
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:55.115
Take a tour of the facility,

1578
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:55.115
get back on the bus, leave.

1579
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.908
All the lights go back off.

1580
00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:01.413
Rodman investors,

1581
00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:01.413
invest in a bunch.

1582
00:43:03.123 --> 00:43:06.584
You continue to find really

1583
00:43:03.123 --> 00:43:06.584
interesting anomalies in China.

1584
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.171
I talked to the people

1585
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.171
who were running

1586
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.171
the industrial gases

1587
00:43:09.338 --> 00:43:10.506
that were feeding a steel mill.

1588
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:12.466
"We're making a profit

1589
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:12.466
on this now,"

1590
00:43:12.674 --> 00:43:14.259
and then they said,

1591
00:43:12.674 --> 00:43:14.259
"Yes, but there's a problem.

1592
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.513
It seems that

1593
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.513
the gauges were wrong,

1594
00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:21.433
and we, uh, did not deliver

1595
00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:21.433
as much gas

1596
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:23.477
as we charged

1597
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:23.477
the steel mill for."

1598
00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:25.020
I said,

1599
00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:25.020
"When did you find this out?"

1600
00:43:25.187 --> 00:43:26.604
They said, "Just last week."

1601
00:43:27.189 --> 00:43:29.065
I said, "And how much were

1602
00:43:27.189 --> 00:43:29.065
the gauges wrong?"

1603
00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:31.651
"Uh, by the exact amount

1604
00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:31.651
of our profit.

1605
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.654
It's very strange."

1606
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:55.008
I've been told I am addressing

1607
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:55.008
the Honorable Ho,

1608
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.886
whose ancestors have been

1609
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.886
the glory of their provinces.

1610
00:43:58.303 --> 00:44:01.515
I am humble Ho,

1611
00:43:58.303 --> 00:44:01.515
whose name stands in deep shadow

1612
00:44:01.848 --> 00:44:03.725
before the tincture

1613
00:44:01.848 --> 00:44:03.725
of the great company.

1614
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:08.313
In China, business is done

1615
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:08.313
following a tradition

1616
00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:11.900
of not having a particularly

1617
00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:11.900
strong legal system.

1618
00:44:12.234 --> 00:44:16.154
So people rely more on trust

1619
00:44:12.234 --> 00:44:16.154
and on personal relationships.

1620
00:44:16.363 --> 00:44:18.865
I shall gain merit in the eyes

1621
00:44:16.363 --> 00:44:18.865
of the company

1622
00:44:16.363 --> 00:44:18.865
by being so trusted.

1623
00:44:20.075 --> 00:44:23.245
There's a lot of focus

1624
00:44:20.075 --> 00:44:23.245
on building those relationships

1625
00:44:23.537 --> 00:44:25.372
so that you can build the trust.

1626
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.667
The Chinese call this network

1627
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.667
of personal relationships,

1628
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.667
guanxi.

1629
00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:33.213
Paul: And so I give you small

1630
00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:33.213
gifts and I do you favors,

1631
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.840
and then you owe me one.

1632
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.840
You scratch my back,

1633
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:36.925
I'll scratch yours.

1634
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:40.095
Paul: If you do enough favors

1635
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:40.095
of people,

1636
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:42.764
you have the ability

1637
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:42.764
to call on them

1638
00:44:43.056 --> 00:44:45.808
for a favor that might be

1639
00:44:43.056 --> 00:44:45.808
quite inconvenient for them.

1640
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.187
And that they would feel

1641
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.187
an obligation

1642
00:44:49.438 --> 00:44:50.606
to actually go forward.

1643
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:57.571
Narrator: This notion

1644
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:57.571
that guanxi

1645
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:57.571
wasn't just trading favors

1646
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.698
but represented something

1647
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.698
more powerful is crucial.

1648
00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:05.161
Dan had told me that going

1649
00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:05.161
after Chinese companies,

1650
00:45:05.412 --> 00:45:07.914
could be dangerous.

1651
00:45:05.412 --> 00:45:07.914
But it wasn't until he told me

1652
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.000
the story of Alfred Little

1653
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.000
that I really understood

1654
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.000
what he meant.

1655
00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:14.630
Dune: When these short reports

1656
00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:14.630
started coming out,

1657
00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:16.465
there was a website

1658
00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:16.465
called Alfred Little.

1659
00:45:17.507 --> 00:45:20.427
And it started publishing these

1660
00:45:17.507 --> 00:45:20.427
very interesting reports,

1661
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.137
the sort of the shoe leather,

1662
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.137
like,

1663
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.889
"We've gone out and we sat

1664
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.889
in front of this factory,

1665
00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:26.516
and this is what we found."

1666
00:45:27.976 --> 00:45:31.271
The website described

1667
00:45:27.976 --> 00:45:31.271
Alfred Little

1668
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:34.983
as an investor

1669
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:34.983
with 35 years of experience,

1670
00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:36.943
I think he was supposed

1671
00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:36.943
to have worked at Deloitte.

1672
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.736
You know, maybe he lived

1673
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.736
in Shanghai.

1674
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.656
I mean, there was this whole

1675
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.656
backstory, right?

1676
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:43.741
Dan: He basically says that,

1677
00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:45.785
all these companies

1678
00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:45.785
in China are fraud,

1679
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.037
are just wholesale bullshit.

1680
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.290
And I was dismissive of it.

1681
00:45:50.624 --> 00:45:52.750
I can't remember the date,

1682
00:45:50.624 --> 00:45:52.750
but I got an email saying,

1683
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:56.421
"I'm gonna be in New York.

1684
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:56.421
Let's meet."

1685
00:45:57.005 --> 00:45:59.675
I was like, "Oh, okay,"

1686
00:45:57.005 --> 00:45:59.675
so I go to this hotel,

1687
00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:02.051
and there's this guy,

1688
00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:02.051
and he's like,

1689
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.136
"Oh, I'm Jon Carnes."

1690
00:46:03.845 --> 00:46:05.472
Like,

1691
00:46:03.845 --> 00:46:05.472
"I'm the guy who's been...

1692
00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:06.931
you know, I'm Alfred Little."

1693
00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:06.931
(laughs)

1694
00:46:12.729 --> 00:46:16.232
(alarm bell ringing)

1695
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:18.985
Narrator: As one of the few

1696
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:18.985
Westerners still working

1697
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:18.985
as a short seller

1698
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:20.236
inside China,

1699
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.281
Carnes knew how to be careful

1700
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.281
and cover his tracks.

1701
00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:26.535
Posing as Alfred Little

1702
00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:26.535
had served him well.

1703
00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:30.163
But when he decided

1704
00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:30.163
to take on Silvercorp,

1705
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.790
a mining company

1706
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.790
in rural Hunan province,

1707
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:36.586
he and his investigators

1708
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:36.586
would find out the dark side

1709
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:36.586
of guanxi.

1710
00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:39.464
You know, some companies

1711
00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:39.464
are more aggressive than others,

1712
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:44.678
but in general, I've found that

1713
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:44.678
the more truthful the report,

1714
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:48.848
the more difficult it is

1715
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:48.848
for a company to explain

1716
00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:51.267
these negative truths,

1717
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:56.314
the more likely they're going

1718
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:56.314
to commit some form

1719
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:56.314
of retaliation.

1720
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.401
Because if

1721
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.401
a company can't answer

1722
00:46:59.568 --> 00:47:01.611
the questions raised

1723
00:46:59.568 --> 00:47:01.611
by the short seller,

1724
00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:07.450
then they look for other means

1725
00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:07.450
to stop the negative reports.

1726
00:47:07.743 --> 00:47:09.952
(wind blowing)

1727
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:12.997
Narrator: As Alfred Little

1728
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:12.997
began to publicly

1729
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:12.997
question Silvercorp,

1730
00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:15.083
the company's stock price

1731
00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:15.083
started to drop.

1732
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.502
Company officials called

1733
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.502
in favors

1734
00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:18.920
with the local authorities.

1735
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:21.881
Police began to threaten

1736
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:21.881
Little's chief researcher,

1737
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.216
Kun Huang,

1738
00:47:24.384 --> 00:47:26.469
detaining him for hours

1739
00:47:24.384 --> 00:47:26.469
or days at a time,

1740
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.180
demanding to know whom

1741
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.180
he was really working for.

1742
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:31.433
(siren wailing)

1743
00:47:31.808 --> 00:47:33.851
Carnes knew that

1744
00:47:31.808 --> 00:47:33.851
there was no cavalry coming.

1745
00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.314
He'd asked the SEC for help,

1746
00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.314
and they said their phones,

1747
00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.314
couldn't even dial China,

1748
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.400
let alone protect him

1749
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.400
and his team.

1750
00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:42.819
(speaking in Mandarin)

1751
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.405
He sent another researcher

1752
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.405
to secretly record evidence

1753
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.617
that local police

1754
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.617
officials were doing

1755
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.617
Silvercorp's bidding.

1756
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.621
He would use the videos

1757
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.621
as leverage to try

1758
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.621
and keep Kun out of jail.

1759
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:54.872
(in Mandarin)

1760
00:48:29.616 --> 00:48:32.661
(man speaking Mandarin)

1761
00:48:42.629 --> 00:48:46.299
Kun: (in Mandarin)

1762
00:49:08.613 --> 00:49:10.031
Narrator:

1763
00:49:08.613 --> 00:49:10.031
Kun had made secret videos

1764
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:11.867
of Silvercorp's

1765
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:11.867
under performing mines,

1766
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.327
and some of the local officials

1767
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.327
they had bribed.

1768
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:17.664
He was detained briefly

1769
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:17.664
twice in late 2011,

1770
00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:20.041
and officials promised

1771
00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:20.041
to leave him alone

1772
00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:21.959
if he would expose

1773
00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:21.959
and denounce Alfred Little.

1774
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:25.129
He refused,

1775
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:25.129
and later that year,

1776
00:49:25.338 --> 00:49:28.049
he was stopped at the border

1777
00:49:25.338 --> 00:49:28.049
as he tried to flee

1778
00:49:25.338 --> 00:49:28.049
to Hong Kong.

1779
00:49:29.551 --> 00:49:34.556
(in Mandarin)

1780
00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:44.607
(indistinct voices over radio)

1781
00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:16.073
(siren wailing)

1782
00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:21.078
Dan: What...

1783
00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:21.078
how many shares short am I?

1784
00:51:26.668 --> 00:51:27.627
No shit.

1785
00:51:27.961 --> 00:51:29.086
- (knocking at door)

1786
00:51:27.961 --> 00:51:29.086
- Hmm.

1787
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.799
Narrator:

1788
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.799
Before Jon was exposed

1789
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.799
as Alfred Little,

1790
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.467
Dan thought he was a crackpot.

1791
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:35.802
Jon: Hey...

1792
00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:37.804
Narrator: Now, along

1793
00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:37.804
with Carson, Matt, and Soren,

1794
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.388
they're part of

1795
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.388
a loose-knit tribe.

1796
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.267
Activist short sellers chasing

1797
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.267
down frauds in China.

1798
00:51:44.477 --> 00:51:45.520
Most of them are realists,

1799
00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:48.314
believing the market finds

1800
00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:48.314
the truth on its own.

1801
00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:50.817
Dan is different.

1802
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:52.986
He takes it personally.

1803
00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:57.991
Jon: Kun keeps going to

1804
00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:57.991
the psychologist once a week.

1805
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:01.661
That was a great thing

1806
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:01.661
you did, though...

1807
00:52:03.496 --> 00:52:04.455
Not cutting him loose.

1808
00:52:05.874 --> 00:52:07.625
Taking care of him

1809
00:52:05.874 --> 00:52:07.625
while he was over there.

1810
00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:11.587
How many of these other guys

1811
00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:11.587
we know would've

1812
00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:11.587
just cut him loose.

1813
00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:13.756
We owe him a lot.

1814
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:17.052
Narrator:

1815
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:17.052
Kun's imprisonment changed Dan.

1816
00:52:17.844 --> 00:52:18.970
As far as he was concerned,

1817
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:22.015
this wasn't about

1818
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:22.015
just uncovering frauds anymore.

1819
00:52:22.974 --> 00:52:24.475
It was about right and wrong.

1820
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.312
His friend had gone to jail,

1821
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.481
and millions of people

1822
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.481
were being ripped off.

1823
00:52:31.066 --> 00:52:32.567
He wanted government action,

1824
00:52:32.817 --> 00:52:34.069
even if it meant

1825
00:52:32.817 --> 00:52:34.069
putting himself

1826
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:35.862
and the other shorts

1827
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:35.862
out of business.

1828
00:52:36.529 --> 00:52:39.032
So he hired a lobbyist and came

1829
00:52:36.529 --> 00:52:39.032
up with a plan to try

1830
00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:40.575
and make Congress

1831
00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:40.575
pay attention.

1832
00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:44.453
Both Toomey and Casey, are

1833
00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:44.453
on the Senate Finance Committee.

1834
00:52:45.121 --> 00:52:46.622
- Mm-hmm.

1835
00:52:45.121 --> 00:52:46.622
- So what I was asking for is

1836
00:52:46.873 --> 00:52:48.290
a Senate Finance hearing.

1837
00:52:48.624 --> 00:52:50.251
You're, you're talking

1838
00:52:48.624 --> 00:52:50.251
to staffers who bounce

1839
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.961
from meeting to meeting

1840
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.961
to meeting to meeting

1841
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.961
to meeting.

1842
00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:53.880
So I think a lot

1843
00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:53.880
of people don't even know,

1844
00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:53.880
this really happened.

1845
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:55.673
Anyone I talked to,

1846
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:55.673
anyone even involved

1847
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.841
in the stock market,

1848
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.841
doesn't even know.

1849
00:52:57.008 --> 00:52:57.926
A lot of people don't know.

1850
00:52:58.051 --> 00:52:59.385
So here's the frustrating part.

1851
00:52:59.594 --> 00:53:02.055
It was the first meeting

1852
00:52:59.594 --> 00:53:02.055
that we had with Toomey's staff.

1853
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.808
Um, he, he actually suggested,

1854
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.808
after an hour and a half,

1855
00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:07.602
- a letter-writing campaign.

1856
00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:07.602
- Right.

1857
00:53:07.894 --> 00:53:10.813
Number one, you know,

1858
00:53:07.894 --> 00:53:10.813
welcome to 2016.

1859
00:53:11.773 --> 00:53:13.900
Um,

1860
00:53:11.773 --> 00:53:13.900
but I guess those still work.

1861
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:16.527
Two, I spent an hour explaining

1862
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:16.527
to him,

1863
00:53:17.153 --> 00:53:18.654
that nobody knows

1864
00:53:17.153 --> 00:53:18.654
they're being ripped off.

1865
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:21.032
How do I get people

1866
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:21.032
to write a letter

1867
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:22.742
about what they don't know

1868
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:22.742
is happening?

1869
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:26.328
If we give up, you know

1870
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:26.328
what happens out of Washington,

1871
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:26.328
nothing.

1872
00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.082
You have to be at the hearing.

1873
00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.082
You have to consider yourself

1874
00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.082
an expert.

1875
00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:30.291
That's why we're going

1876
00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:30.291
to Washington,

1877
00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:31.333
That's where we're trying

1878
00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:31.333
to effect change.

1879
00:53:33.128 --> 00:53:34.211
(hand thumps table)

1880
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:36.338
- It's a very frustrating thing.

1881
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:36.338
- Mm-hmm.

1882
00:53:36.672 --> 00:53:37.423
And I just...

1883
00:53:39.467 --> 00:53:41.427
don't want to hear how

1884
00:53:39.467 --> 00:53:41.427
the world works anymore.

1885
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.602
(wind whistling)

1886
00:53:49.978 --> 00:53:50.979
Narrator: Dan had a plan.

1887
00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:54.398
(train rattling)

1888
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:57.735
There was a Senate hearing

1889
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:57.735
on whether or not

1890
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:57.735
the Chinese economy

1891
00:53:58.111 --> 00:53:59.946
poses a strategic danger

1892
00:53:58.111 --> 00:53:59.946
to our economy.

1893
00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:03.992
He'd use it as

1894
00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:03.992
an opportunity to meet

1895
00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:03.992
with his senator Toomey.

1896
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.202
And get him to listen

1897
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.202
to his concerns.

1898
00:54:06.494 --> 00:54:07.662
Would you vote for him

1899
00:54:06.494 --> 00:54:07.662
at this point?

1900
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.289
- How'd I vote?

1901
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.289
- Oh, right, right.

1902
00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:12.416
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1903
00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:12.416
I'm having a casual conversation

1904
00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:13.626
with you and I forget.

1905
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:17.546
Well, let me just say this,

1906
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:17.546
I won't vote

1907
00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:18.547
for the motherfucker.

1908
00:54:19.007 --> 00:54:21.634
(train rattling)

1909
00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:34.814
Dan: I think that there are

1910
00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:34.814
a great many people

1911
00:54:35.148 --> 00:54:36.816
that it's their job

1912
00:54:35.148 --> 00:54:36.816
to give a shit.

1913
00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:40.444
If you're going to run

1914
00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:40.444
for office on the idea

1915
00:54:40.695 --> 00:54:43.781
that you're there to protect

1916
00:54:40.695 --> 00:54:43.781
citizens' interests...

1917
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.911
The rights of citizens,

1918
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.911
then you should do your job.

1919
00:54:49.245 --> 00:54:50.079
Thank you, sir.

1920
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.208
Or let somebody else do it,

1921
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.208
that will do it.

1922
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.592
(indistinct chatter)

1923
00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:11.684
(gavel banging)

1924
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.231
Shelby: Today, the Committee

1925
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.231
will hear testimony

1926
00:55:16.564 --> 00:55:19.358
on the Chinese economy

1927
00:55:16.564 --> 00:55:19.358
and the risk it may pose

1928
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.609
to the United States.

1929
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.821
Some believe

1930
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.821
that China's economic stimulus,

1931
00:55:24.072 --> 00:55:26.699
following the 2008

1932
00:55:24.072 --> 00:55:26.699
financial crisis,

1933
00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:28.910
has left the financial system

1934
00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:31.996
with an unusually high

1935
00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:31.996
percentage of bad debts.

1936
00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:35.416
China's not transitioned, uh,

1937
00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:35.416
to a market economy.

1938
00:55:35.583 --> 00:55:37.418
It's not lived up

1939
00:55:35.583 --> 00:55:37.418
to the commitments it made

1940
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.420
when it joined

1941
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.420
the World Trade Organization.

1942
00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.463
Chinese government props

1943
00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.463
up its state-owned enterprises,

1944
00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:43.216
also called SOEs,

1945
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:46.844
and designated private firms,

1946
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:46.844
while limiting market access

1947
00:55:47.095 --> 00:55:48.429
for U.S.

1948
00:55:47.095 --> 00:55:48.429
and other foreign firms.

1949
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:51.266
Narrator: Dan had hoped

1950
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:51.266
that Senator Toomey

1951
00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:53.392
would address some of

1952
00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:53.392
the questions he'd raised

1953
00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:53.392
with his staff.

1954
00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:56.145
But he left the hearing early.

1955
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.232
And it went downhill

1956
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.232
from there.

1957
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:04.028
I'm not sure that I see this

1958
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:04.028
as something that we really need

1959
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.362
to be too worried about.

1960
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.489
What we do need

1961
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.489
to be worried about more,

1962
00:56:08.116 --> 00:56:11.535
is the continuation

1963
00:56:08.116 --> 00:56:11.535
of the imbalances in China

1964
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.579
and what that might imply...

1965
00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:14.496
(gavel banging)

1966
00:56:20.753 --> 00:56:23.172
How fast is

1967
00:56:20.753 --> 00:56:23.172
the Chinese economy growing?

1968
00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:26.884
I don't know exactly.

1969
00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:26.884
We don't have reliable figures.

1970
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:28.261
Desmond: You know,

1971
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:28.261
I pretty much agree

1972
00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:31.055
that China's not growing

1973
00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:31.055
at 6.7 percent.

1974
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.682
It's rather growing

1975
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.682
at something, uh,

1976
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.682
like 4 percent.

1977
00:56:34.267 --> 00:56:37.353
So, if the Chinese

1978
00:56:34.267 --> 00:56:37.353
credit bubble pops,

1979
00:56:38.187 --> 00:56:39.939
whether it's sooner or later,

1980
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:43.192
dragging the Chinese economy

1981
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:43.192
down with it,

1982
00:56:43.484 --> 00:56:46.612
what kinds of vulnerabilities

1983
00:56:43.484 --> 00:56:46.612
might we see?

1984
00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:50.491
I don't see the impact as being

1985
00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:50.491
through direct exposure

1986
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.244
- of United States companies...

1987
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.244
- So, so you're not worried

1988
00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:56.122
about the exposure

1989
00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:56.122
through derivatives

1990
00:56:56.331 --> 00:56:58.166
that, for example,

1991
00:56:56.331 --> 00:56:58.166
put our banks,

1992
00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:02.628
deeply engaged on the question

1993
00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:02.628
of commodity prices

1994
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:05.006
or other financial

1995
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:05.006
transactions more direct?

1996
00:57:05.298 --> 00:57:07.675
Not through China itself...

1997
00:57:08.092 --> 00:57:12.763
(indistinct chatter)

1998
00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:17.768
I'm Dan David.

1999
00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:17.768
I believe Tom gave you

2000
00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:17.768
my book there.

2001
00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:19.145
- Oh, yes.

2002
00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:19.145
- Yeah.

2003
00:57:19.395 --> 00:57:20.188
I'll believe you'll find that--

2004
00:57:20.355 --> 00:57:21.189
"The China Hustle."

2005
00:57:21.314 --> 00:57:23.065
That's right. That's right.

2006
00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:24.984
If you, uh, read that

2007
00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:24.984
and you're interested,

2008
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:26.819
I'd love to talk

2009
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:26.819
to you about it.

2010
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:29.364
- Okay.

2011
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:29.364
- So, couple of hundred billion

2012
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:29.364
in fraud, and it continues.

2013
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:31.949
It's not over.

2014
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:31.949
It goes on every day.

2015
00:57:32.241 --> 00:57:33.450
- Great.

2016
00:57:32.241 --> 00:57:33.450
- Yeah, any one of them.

2017
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:38.789
Dan: Very cursory and...

2018
00:57:39.123 --> 00:57:40.916
- Okay.

2019
00:57:39.123 --> 00:57:40.916
- ...dismissive and generic.

2020
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.668
- Anecdotal.

2021
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.668
- The only thing I heard

2022
00:57:42.877 --> 00:57:44.879
at the end

2023
00:57:42.877 --> 00:57:44.879
was Shelby saying, uh,

2024
00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:46.630
you know, we got

2025
00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:46.630
to face reality.

2026
00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:48.924
- That was it.

2027
00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:48.924
- Okay, the reality is,

2028
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.801
- they're gonna do nothing

2029
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.801
about it.

2030
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.801
- Right.

2031
00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:54.347
The biggest, eh, you know,

2032
00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:54.347
you can guarantee losing

2033
00:57:54.847 --> 00:57:56.307
- by not doing anything.

2034
00:57:54.847 --> 00:57:56.307
- Dan: That's right.

2035
00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:57.766
(door closes with a thud)

2036
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:03.356
Man: Uh, why did you come down

2037
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:03.356
to Washington?

2038
00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:06.859
Dan: I was hoping

2039
00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:06.859
to move the ball forward,

2040
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:08.986
advocating

2041
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:08.986
for investors' rights,

2042
00:58:09.278 --> 00:58:12.323
to... show up and see

2043
00:58:09.278 --> 00:58:12.323
what's actually done

2044
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:13.490
at a committee hearing.

2045
00:58:14.783 --> 00:58:16.160
Man:

2046
00:58:14.783 --> 00:58:16.160
What happened at the hearing?

2047
00:58:16.952 --> 00:58:17.786
Not much.

2048
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.500
(siren wailing)

2049
00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:26.087
Jon: I think

2050
00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:26.087
that what Dan's doing to try

2051
00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:30.507
to get Congress to take action,

2052
00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:30.507
is a good thing.

2053
00:58:32.093 --> 00:58:34.511
Do I think that's the way

2054
00:58:32.093 --> 00:58:34.511
to solve the problem? No.

2055
00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:36.513
I don't think so.

2056
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:41.143
The entire staff of

2057
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:41.143
the SEC hasn't busted,

2058
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:43.145
more than one or two

2059
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:43.145
of these frauds.

2060
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:46.023
A handful of short sellers

2061
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:46.023
have busted,

2062
00:58:46.232 --> 00:58:47.442
forty or fifty of these frauds.

2063
00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.745
Dan: Coach, you need one?

2064
00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.081
- Yeah, I guess so.

2065
00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.081
- Is he still living out

2066
00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.081
in France?

2067
00:59:02.915 --> 00:59:04.583
Dan: Excuse me, ladies,

2068
00:59:02.915 --> 00:59:04.583
can I get you anything?

2069
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.043
Soda, water, beer?

2070
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.004
Pop, can you get Sean a beer?

2071
00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:11.924
- No, he can help himself.

2072
00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:11.924
- (all laugh)

2073
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:13.008
He's a big guy.

2074
00:59:13.384 --> 00:59:15.844
- (all laugh)

2075
00:59:13.384 --> 00:59:15.844
- Uh-huh.

2076
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.679
- Dan: Geo Investing.

2077
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.679
- Man: G-O?

2078
00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:19.014
Dan: G-E-O.

2079
00:59:19.474 --> 00:59:20.933
(indistinct chatter)

2080
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.643
- Dan: I'll bet against them.

2081
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.643
- (all laugh)

2082
00:59:22.935 --> 00:59:24.812
And I'll write a report,

2083
00:59:22.935 --> 00:59:24.812
and I'll publish it.

2084
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:28.107
And I'll say they're a fraud

2085
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:28.107
and I'm short.

2086
00:59:29.275 --> 00:59:30.609
But when they do go to zero,

2087
00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:34.029
I win, but you all lose.

2088
00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:35.739
We're losing our ass.

2089
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.200
Started out good.

2090
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.200
We didn't get any...

2091
00:59:38.326 --> 00:59:40.495
Dan: This is the skim that comes

2092
00:59:38.326 --> 00:59:40.495
out of everybody's account.

2093
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:42.497
It's pennies from everyone...

2094
00:59:43.914 --> 00:59:46.083
that adds up

2095
00:59:43.914 --> 00:59:46.083
to hundreds of billions.

2096
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:49.378
So you're campaigning

2097
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:49.378
to get something to happen.

2098
00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:52.381
Dan: So that I won't

2099
00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:52.381
make money anymore.

2100
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:54.633
- You're a good man, Danny.

2101
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:54.633
- Yeah.

2102
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.968
I always thought

2103
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.968
you were like that.

2104
00:59:56.135 --> 00:59:57.594
- No, you didn't.

2105
00:59:56.135 --> 00:59:57.594
- (all laugh)

2106
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.264
And I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

2107
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.264
It just...

2108
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.641
just doesn't sit well,

2109
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.641
that's all.

2110
01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.061
Explain to me again,

2111
01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.061
why you make money and we don't.

2112
01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.230
You bet against them.

2113
01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.230
That's short them.

2114
01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:10.358
Okay.

2115
01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:13.861
Graduating with a 1.6...

2116
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.613
(laughter)

2117
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.240
(all speaking at once)

2118
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.075
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

2119
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.075
- Dan: There's two things there.

2120
01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.119
Dan: One, I had no idea

2121
01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.119
I actually graduated.

2122
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.621
(laughing)

2123
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:27.749
Carol read something

2124
01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.504
about something going on

2125
01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.504
in China right now,

2126
01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:35.550
where they've discovered

2127
01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:35.550
what they think to be aliens.

2128
01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:37.676
Wasn't it deep down,

2129
01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:37.676
they found 'em?

2130
01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:40.346
(woman speaking indistinctly)

2131
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.847
Well, that would be

2132
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.847
a new wrinkle.

2133
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.850
Well, that would make

2134
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.850
what I've been doing

2135
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.850
the last three years a waste.

2136
01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.435
- Nothin'.

2137
01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.435
- (laughs)

2138
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.563
- Thousands of years ago.

2139
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.563
- Yeah.

2140
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.773
Yup, I think he might not

2141
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.773
come home in one piece.

2142
01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:55.152
(laughter)

2143
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.660
Jim: At the end of the day,

2144
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.660
investors counting on the SEC

2145
01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:09.542
to save them from their own lack

2146
01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:09.542
of due diligence, or greed,

2147
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.335
are kidding themselves.

2148
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.255
Mitch: We have more opportunity

2149
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.255
in our markets than anywhere

2150
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.255
in the world.

2151
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.215
But, at the same time,

2152
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.428
we don't have a regulator

2153
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.428
that looks over our, our filings

2154
01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.721
and says, "I want to protect

2155
01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.721
the public from this."

2156
01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.016
Our system... you know,

2157
01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.016
we file with the SEC,

2158
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.935
and the SEC reads

2159
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.935
the disclosure,

2160
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.935
and they comment

2161
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.728
on, on the disclosure.

2162
01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:31.522
They don't determine

2163
01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:31.522
whether it's viable

2164
01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:31.522
to be public or not.

2165
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.940
They don't make

2166
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.940
that determination.

2167
01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.942
They let the free market make

2168
01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.942
the determination.

2169
01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.362
Warren:

2170
01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.362
The SEC should do its job.

2171
01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.948
Your job is to look out

2172
01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.948
for investors,

2173
01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.659
but you've put the interests

2174
01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.659
of the Chamber of Commerce

2175
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.661
and their big-business members

2176
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.247
at the top

2177
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.247
of your priority list.

2178
01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.000
Narrator: It is the SEC's job

2179
01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.000
to protect investors.

2180
01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.462
But it was chartered

2181
01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.462
in the 1930s,

2182
01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:57.465
at a time when stock prices

2183
01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:57.465
rolled off of ticker tape

2184
01:01:58.132 --> 01:01:59.341
and the markets closed at four.

2185
01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.553
Now, they're outgunned

2186
01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.553
and outmanned,

2187
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:05.640
like Keystone Cops chasing

2188
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:05.640
the starship "Enterprise."

2189
01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.477
Even if the SEC

2190
01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.477
gets its entire wish list

2191
01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.019
of documents from the company

2192
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:13.564
and they have enough evidence

2193
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:13.564
to pursue a case,

2194
01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:17.151
the Chinese people responsible

2195
01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:17.151
for this, don't really care.

2196
01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:18.819
Dan: When somebody breaks

2197
01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:18.819
the law here,

2198
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:22.197
there is a process

2199
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:22.197
where they're accountable.

2200
01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.533
At some point

2201
01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.533
in a China-based company,

2202
01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.285
that accountability ends.

2203
01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.663
And it ends at the ocean.

2204
01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:31.332
Narrator: This is one of

2205
01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:31.332
the first things

2206
01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:31.332
that Dan ever told me.

2207
01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.960
In China, it's not illegal to

2208
01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.960
steal from foreign investors.

2209
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.423
I couldn't believe

2210
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.423
the SEC would allow companies

2211
01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.134
to list on U.S. markets,

2212
01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.134
if it really had no way

2213
01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:43.552
to police them.

2214
01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.014
So I found an employee

2215
01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.014
of the Chinese

2216
01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.014
state financial news agency,

2217
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.808
who was willing to take a risk

2218
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.808
to confirm the truth.

2219
01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:53.729
(in Mandarin)

2220
01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.058
Bottom line is,

2221
01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.268
the Chinese government

2222
01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.268
and the U.S. government,

2223
01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.146
on most levels,

2224
01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.146
don't work that well together.

2225
01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:38.106
(sirens wailing)

2226
01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:40.192
Dan: You can't compel somebody

2227
01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.153
that has stolen millions

2228
01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.153
and millions of dollars

2229
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.532
from U.S. investors

2230
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.532
to come here from China.

2231
01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.660
You can't compel them

2232
01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.660
to testify.

2233
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.829
You can't even find them.

2234
01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:55.332
Dan: Forget about

2235
01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:55.332
the average person

2236
01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.793
who thinks that their broker

2237
01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.793
or the SEC will protect them.

2238
01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.254
Even someone

2239
01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.254
like Crocker Coulson,

2240
01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:03.131
who worked inside the system,

2241
01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:03.131
couldn't find out

2242
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.551
what was really going on

2243
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.551
with these Chinese companies.

2244
01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.428
Crocker: You're in

2245
01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.428
an alternate universe.

2246
01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:08.679
There's kind of this arms race

2247
01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.431
to do the simplest things.

2248
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.266
You can't even look

2249
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.266
at the bank statement.

2250
01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.976
You can't even go into

2251
01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.976
the local bank and ask them.

2252
01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:17.646
A lot of times,

2253
01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:17.646
the manager of the local bank,

2254
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.232
will actually reprogram

2255
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.232
the books of the bank

2256
01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.901
to make it look like the books

2257
01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.901
of his client are better

2258
01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.901
than they are.

2259
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.155
Gregory: Anytime you have

2260
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.155
a country like China,

2261
01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:29.617
where information

2262
01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:29.617
is not easily obtained,

2263
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:33.870
any society like that

2264
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:33.870
is a much greater risk.

2265
01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.665
In the United States,

2266
01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.665
we can go directly to a firm

2267
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.875
and we can subpoena

2268
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.875
those records.

2269
01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.211
To get records out of China

2270
01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.211
is significantly more difficult,

2271
01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:42.797
if not impossible.

2272
01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.592
If you wanted to set out

2273
01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.592
to be a criminal,

2274
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.885
probably the best place

2275
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.885
to be a criminal

2276
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:52.347
is someplace with no cops,

2277
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:52.347
and that was China.

2278
01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:54.182
It was the Wild West.

2279
01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.101
(airplane engines whooshing)

2280
01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.730
(indistinct chatter)

2281
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.295
(horn honking)

2282
01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.932
I am delivered.

2283
01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.932
I'm at the airport.

2284
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:38.435
Just headin' to the hotel.

2285
01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.115
Narrator:

2286
01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.115
Dan was like Nicolas Cage

2287
01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.115
in that movie

2288
01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:55.118
where he's the only one

2289
01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:55.118
who knows that

2290
01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:55.118
the world is going to end.

2291
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.288
He's screaming about it,

2292
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.288
but nobody cares.

2293
01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:03.960
The auditors, the bankers,

2294
01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:03.960
Congress, the SEC...

2295
01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:05.295
(murmuring indistinctly)

2296
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.922
None of them see

2297
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.922
the financial tsunami

2298
01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.965
that Dan sees

2299
01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.965
coming from China.

2300
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:13.053
So he decides to do

2301
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:13.053
the one thing he can do,

2302
01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.013
take the criminals' money.

2303
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.487
Dan: Their share count

2304
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.487
has ballooned,

2305
01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:33.990
from a whopping 4.9 billion

2306
01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:33.990
shares four years ago

2307
01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.993
to 6.5 billion shares today.

2308
01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.371
It appears that the only way

2309
01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.371
that they can continue

2310
01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.039
to sustain

2311
01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.039
their business operation,

2312
01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.708
is through dilutive financing.

2313
01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:46.879
(camera clicking, whooshing)

2314
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.174
Narrator: Normally,

2315
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.174
Dan publishes

2316
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.174
his reports online.

2317
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.219
But this time,

2318
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.219
there's too much at stake,

2319
01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:57.681
a nearly $2 billion company,

2320
01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:57.681
Tech Pro.

2321
01:06:58.724 --> 01:06:59.934
He believes

2322
01:06:58.724 --> 01:06:59.934
the company's chairman,

2323
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.018
is misallocating

2324
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.018
shareholder money

2325
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:03.604
to lavish on pet projects.

2326
01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.774
If he can convince the markets,

2327
01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.774
he'll wipe the company out.

2328
01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.109
It'll be his

2329
01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.109
biggest short ever.

2330
01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.946
Dan: Now, I don't know

2331
01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.946
what that tells anybody else,

2332
01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.948
but, there's something going

2333
01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.948
on here.

2334
01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.910
Our due diligence,

2335
01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.910
is a lot of black smoke,

2336
01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:20.955
lot of black smoke

2337
01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:20.955
coming out of this company.

2338
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.122
That's a fire.

2339
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:25.918
That needs to be looked into.

2340
01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:38.221
(indistinct speech over radio)

2341
01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.224

2342
01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:45.980

Joining us on the floor

2347
01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.082
of the exchange right now,

2348
01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.751
Dan David. He's co-founder

2349
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.420
of due-diligence firm,

2350
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.420
GeoInvesting.

2351
01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:12.547
And I see here,

2352
01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:12.547
you also specialize in China?

2353
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.133
We do.

2354
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.133
My Sohn presentation in June

2355
01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:18.136
on Tech Pro,

2356
01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:18.136
Tech Pro's down 91 percent.

2357
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.263
Woman Host: Is it vindication

2358
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.263
for you when you see a stock

2359
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.223
- like that plummet?

2360
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.223
- Well, it was inevitable.

2361
01:08:22.516 --> 01:08:24.476
I... The stock was always going

2362
01:08:22.516 --> 01:08:24.476
to plummet.

2363
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.938
Are you bullish

2364
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.938
on China at all or is it just...

2365
01:08:28.355 --> 01:08:31.692
(cello playing)

2366
01:08:32.275 --> 01:08:33.861
Dan: What is capitalism?

2367
01:08:36.864 --> 01:08:39.033
Is it an economic system?

2368
01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:42.703
Or is it an apparatus

2369
01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:42.703
that we can use

2370
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.331
to make more money

2371
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.331
for ourselves and take

2372
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.331
more money from others?

2373
01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:53.547
At its heart,

2374
01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:53.547
it rewards those who work hard,

2375
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.092
but it also rewards those

2376
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.092
who are willing

2377
01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.135
to take advantage of others.

2378
01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.985
Narrator: When we describe

2379
01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.985
a fraud like this one,

2380
01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.696
we use terms like

2381
01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.696
"white-collar crime"

2382
01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.031
to distinguish it.

2383
01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:24.202
But really, it's just theft,

2384
01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.497
in its way, as violent

2385
01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.497
as being mugged in the street.

2386
01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:33.253
It can be traumatic to chart

2387
01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:33.253
the trail of personal loss.

2388
01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.883
How much was stolen

2389
01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.883
from each pension fund,

2390
01:09:38.842 --> 01:09:39.634
each retirement fund,

2391
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.054
each of us.

2392
01:09:44.556 --> 01:09:47.601
Soren: The real story

2393
01:09:44.556 --> 01:09:47.601
is the aggregate value.

2394
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:52.147
It's the investors who,

2395
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:52.147
by the end,

2396
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:52.147
were mostly retail investors.

2397
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.067
These were mostly

2398
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.067
just people playing

2399
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.067
the American stock market,

2400
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.652
who looked at the financials

2401
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.652
and believed them.

2402
01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.864
Alexandra: That money is money

2403
01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.864
that belonged

2404
01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:03.784
to individual

2405
01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:03.784
mom-and-pop investors

2406
01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:07.955
who thought, "Hey, I want to be

2407
01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:07.955
a part of

2408
01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:07.955
the China growth story."

2409
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.832
And they were also shares

2410
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.832
that belonged

2411
01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:12.626
to mutual funds, like Vanguard,

2412
01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.504
that manage money for,

2413
01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.504
for example, The New York Times,

2414
01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:18.381
right?

2415
01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:18.381
The employees.

2416
01:10:18.966 --> 01:10:20.383
My pension fund money.

2417
01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:25.139
Roddy: We sold ourselves

2418
01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:25.139
on a myth of China

2419
01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.808
as a really compelling market.

2420
01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:30.644
A nation that wanted

2421
01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:30.644
the leveling effects

2422
01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.020
of free trade.

2423
01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:35.273
Matt: You should

2424
01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:35.273
have known better.

2425
01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.817
Man: Well, what I would pay,

2426
01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:38.401
if I have my money in Fidelity,

2427
01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.820
isn't that...

2428
01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.820
why do I pay these guys?

2429
01:10:40.112 --> 01:10:41.155
I don't know. I don't pay 'em.

2430
01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.614
I don't give 'em any

2431
01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.614
of my money.

2432
01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.368
It's like a game

2433
01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.368
of musical chairs,

2434
01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:48.996
when the music stops,

2435
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.956
if you're left holding

2436
01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.956
the paper,

2437
01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:52.791
if you're left holding

2438
01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:52.791
the shares,

2439
01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.292
you are the victim.

2440
01:10:54.793 --> 01:11:00.256
(sirens wailing)

2441
01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.135
Okay, um, my name is David Yee,

2442
01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:05.095
and I live in Atlanta, Georgia.

2443
01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.472
My name is Ray Snader.

2444
01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.100
I'm a print and broadcast

2445
01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.100
journalist

2446
01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.435
in Newport, Tennessee.

2447
01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:16.439
Tom Snodgrass

2448
01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:16.439
from, uh, Spring, Texas.

2449
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.693
David: What attracted me

2450
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.693
to U.S.-listed Chinese stocks,

2451
01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:21.111
were the high returns.

2452
01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.030
There was a lot of hype

2453
01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.030
about them and

2454
01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:24.239
a lot of attention.

2455
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.869
I was hoping to have

2456
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.869
a nice retirement egg

2457
01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.411
for my wife and myself.

2458
01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:34.833
I do not have

2459
01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:34.833
a retirement plan at my job.

2460
01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.419
My wife doesn't have

2461
01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.419
a retirement plan at her job.

2462
01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.050
Roth Capital, issued

2463
01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.050
a buy recommendation.

2464
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.386
The first company that really

2465
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.386
kind of caught my eye,

2466
01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.222
was AgFeed.

2467
01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.222
Allegedly they were

2468
01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.349
the largest

2469
01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.349
feed producer in China.

2470
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.645
My last shares,

2471
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.645
that I purchased,

2472
01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:57.397
were $9 a share.

2473
01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:05.197
We recouped...12 cents

2474
01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:05.197
on the share.

2475
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:10.326
And, we had a total

2476
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:10.326
of about 26,000 shares.

2477
01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.581
Man: What kind of loss did

2478
01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.581
that represent for you,

2479
01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.581
personally?

2480
01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.167
It represented,

2481
01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.335
about a $150,000.

2482
01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:25.092
I think I lost well,

2483
01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:25.092
well in excess of a $100,000.

2484
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.635
My investment in these

2485
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.635
U.S. listed Chinese companies,

2486
01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.513
represented at least 50 percent

2487
01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.513
of my assets.

2488
01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.682
The prices tanked,

2489
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:37.187
and they were eventually, um,

2490
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:37.187
delisted and not tradable.

2491
01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:41.108
- Man: Worth zero.

2492
01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:41.108
- Worth $0 per share.

2493
01:12:41.233 --> 01:12:44.652
We put our faith in the market,

2494
01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.363
in our government

2495
01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.363
to police that market.

2496
01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:51.659
And I think, uh, we got burned

2497
01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:51.659
on literally every turn,

2498
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.370
in that particular transaction.

2499
01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.793
Ray: Roth Capital issued

2500
01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.793
a buy recommendation.

2501
01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:05.548
I'm not sure that they visited

2502
01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:05.548
the plant at all in China.

2503
01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.717
In fact, today,

2504
01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:13.223
I'm not sure that there was

2505
01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:13.223
a China Electric Motor company.

2506
01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:19.395
- How old are you, Ray?

2507
01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:19.395
- I'm 68 years old.

2508
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.692
(cello playing)

2509
01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.320
Narrator: So where

2510
01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.320
did the money go?

2511
01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:30.782
To the bankers and lawyers,

2512
01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.408
who helped set up the deals.

2513
01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.288
And to the Chinese executives

2514
01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.288
who made millions

2515
01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:37.831
while their

2516
01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:37.831
companies collapsed.

2517
01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:40.792
I don't know what's worse,

2518
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.503
that the executives were beyond

2519
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.503
the reach of the law,

2520
01:13:44.296 --> 01:13:46.422
or that the enablers

2521
01:13:44.296 --> 01:13:46.422
on Wall Street were operating

2522
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.134
inside the law,

2523
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.134
just doing their jobs.

2524
01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:53.054
One way or another, almost all

2525
01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:53.054
of them got away with it,

2526
01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:54.348
scot-free.

2527
01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:57.642
One exception,

2528
01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:57.642
was Rodman & Renshaw.

2529
01:13:57.976 --> 01:13:59.394
Do you have just a moment,

2530
01:13:57.976 --> 01:13:59.394
General?

2531
01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.895
No.

2532
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:02.772
During the heyday

2533
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:02.772
of the reverse-merger boom,

2534
01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:05.317
they doled out

2535
01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:05.317
almost $18 million

2536
01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:06.818
in bonuses to their executives.

2537
01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:08.903
But their problems

2538
01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:08.903
caught up with them.

2539
01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:10.697
In 2012,

2540
01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.408
they paid a $315,000 fine

2541
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.660
and surrendered

2542
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.660
their brokers license.

2543
01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:18.454
Soon after,

2544
01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:18.454
they filed for bankruptcy.

2545
01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:21.416
Wesley: So I want

2546
01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:21.416
to make sure you understand.

2547
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.918
My investment bank

2548
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.918
is called Enverra.

2549
01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.712
- Man: Right.

2550
01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.712
- It's not Rodman & Renshaw.

2551
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.547
- Right.

2552
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.547
- I was the chairman

2553
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.547
of Rodman & Renshaw,

2554
01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:30.300
I was not a banker

2555
01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:30.300
at Rodman & Renshaw.

2556
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.469
I didn't have anything to do

2557
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.469
with the financial transactions

2558
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.469
in China.

2559
01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:35.596
That wasn't me.

2560
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.141
I'm the guy that told them,

2561
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.141
"You got a problem with it."

2562
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.311
And I left the company, uh,

2563
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.311
a year or so,

2564
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.188
18 months after that,

2565
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.188
from the board.

2566
01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.733
My question is,

2567
01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.733
who did he tell?

2568
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.527
How about, "And then

2569
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.527
I went down to Washington

2570
01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:51.821
and saw all the people

2571
01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:51.821
that I know while I was running

2572
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.822
for president...

2573
01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.409
and told them

2574
01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.409
what was going on"?

2575
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.077
I don't think I want

2576
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.077
to be in the film.

2577
01:14:57.202 --> 01:15:00.955
I think it's just...

2578
01:14:57.202 --> 01:15:00.955
it, it invites attacks on me.

2579
01:15:01.248 --> 01:15:03.417
And I don't need that.

2580
01:15:01.248 --> 01:15:03.417
I'm trying to build a business.

2581
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.169
I don't want to be attacked.

2582
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.169
I didn't do anything wrong.

2583
01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:07.837
You're chairman of the board.

2584
01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:07.837
What role was it?

2585
01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:09.381
A non-executive chairman

2586
01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:09.381
of the board?

2587
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.049
Was he the person

2588
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.049
who ran the business,

2589
01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.842
or was he really there

2590
01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.842
as a figurehead,

2591
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:14.928
to lend his name

2592
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:14.928
to the credibility

2593
01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.054
of this situation?

2594
01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.513
I mean, that's the classic.

2595
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:19.682
It's like Monica Lewinsky.

2596
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:21.684
Forget about Monica Lewinsky.

2597
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:21.684
It doesn't matter

2598
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.020
what you say about it.

2599
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.020
It's a bad story.

2600
01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.606
So let's, let's

2601
01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.606
just cancel this session, okay?

2602
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.483
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.

2603
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.483
- Matt: Do I,

2604
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.318
do I send

2605
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.318
shame on people?

2606
01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:32.528
Do I say, "Shame on you

2607
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.364
for not asking

2608
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.364
the right questions?

2609
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.908
Shame on the auditors

2610
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.908
for allowing this shit

2611
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.908
to go through?

2612
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.743
Shame on the regulators

2613
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.743
for not making

2614
01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:41.162
the, the requirements

2615
01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:41.162
more stringent and difficult"?

2616
01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.664
So, you don't think

2617
01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.664
we have a problem here?

2618
01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:46.000
You want to blame this

2619
01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:46.000
on any one or two people?

2620
01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:47.252
(stammers)

2621
01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:47.252
Ridiculous.

2622
01:15:48.128 --> 01:15:50.588
It's ridiculous.

2623
01:15:48.128 --> 01:15:50.588
The whole thing is b...

2624
01:15:48.128 --> 01:15:50.588
is broken.

2625
01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:53.174
It's broken.

2626
01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.635
Wesley: Let's get out of this.

2627
01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.635
This is a mistake for me.

2628
01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:57.553
It's a mistake for the people

2629
01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:57.553
that depend on me.

2630
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:58.721
I've got a firm.

2631
01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.474
I've got people

2632
01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.474
that work for me.

2633
01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:04.185
I owe them my best opportunity

2634
01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:04.185
to give them a living.

2635
01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.771
And, this doesn't help.

2636
01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.771
This hurts.

2637
01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:08.564
So I want out of this.

2638
01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:10.984
Man: Well, I'm not...

2639
01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.445
This is not an attack piece

2640
01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.445
on you, sir.

2641
01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:14.988
Wesley: It doesn't help...

2642
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.906
Man: That's not,

2643
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.906
that's not my intention,

2644
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.906
nor is that...

2645
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.326
Wesley: Uh, I thought

2646
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.326
I could do this

2647
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.326
in an academic way,

2648
01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:21.328
but I realize I can't.

2649
01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:23.079
You know?

2650
01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:23.079
I...

2651
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.835
Roddy: China is fundamentally

2652
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:32.464
a broken

2653
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:32.464
or fucked-up societal system.

2654
01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.132
The people who get to the top,

2655
01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:37.511
get to the top

2656
01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:37.511
by breaking rules.

2657
01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.305
Good people who want

2658
01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.305
to play by the rules,

2659
01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:42.849
get stepped on and pushed

2660
01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:42.849
to the bottom of the pile.

2661
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.185
This, in some ways,

2662
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.185
has nothing to do with China.

2663
01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:46.811
If you gave American

2664
01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:46.811
management teams

2665
01:16:46.978 --> 01:16:48.062
that incentive structure,

2666
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.606
oh, my God, we'd have

2667
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.606
the same amount of fraud here.

2668
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.485
It was just a no-brainer

2669
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.485
for them.

2670
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.196
Bulls versus bears, constantly.

2671
01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:58.906
And now that I'm deemed a bear,

2672
01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.494
I don't know if I'm ever

2673
01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.494
gonna be able to go back

2674
01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.494
to the bull side.

2675
01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.625
But, no regrets working

2676
01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.625
for them.

2677
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.920
My clients made money.

2678
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.920
(inhales)

2679
01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:17.675
Ping:

2680
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.065
We've never seen

2681
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.065
a credit buildup

2682
01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.192
to the likes of what

2683
01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.192
China is doing today,

2684
01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:38.363
that hasn't been followed by a,

2685
01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:38.363
a major, major financial crisis.

2686
01:17:38.905 --> 01:17:40.198
So, stay tuned.

2687
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.618
We, we have, by far,

2688
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.618
the most vibrant markets

2689
01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:44.911
in the world. By far!

2690
01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:48.748
And so, that freedom,

2691
01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:48.748
leaving those decisions

2692
01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:50.875
to the private sector, you know,

2693
01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.461
it, it frees up

2694
01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.461
a lot, a lot of capital.

2695
01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.255
This is the largest

2696
01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.255
financial crime

2697
01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:58.132
of the last 25 years, with

2698
01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:58.132
the exception of Bernie Madoff.

2699
01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:02.136
It's still way too easy

2700
01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:02.136
for the bad guys in finance

2701
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.055
to keep Washington

2702
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.055
off their backs.

2703
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.766
We're cutting regulations.

2704
01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.852
I would say 70 percent

2705
01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.852
of the regulations can go.

2706
01:18:11.479 --> 01:18:13.981
I think you see a lot

2707
01:18:11.479 --> 01:18:13.981
of the similarities with

2708
01:18:11.479 --> 01:18:13.981
the mortgage crisis

2709
01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:17.110
in, in '08

2710
01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:17.110
and the China situation.

2711
01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:20.238
We had our chances,

2712
01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:20.238
post-global financial crisis,

2713
01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:22.156
in my opinion,

2714
01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:22.156
and we missed it.

2715
01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.825
This was sort of the appetizer,

2716
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.703
in, in that these were

2717
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.703
the small, crappy companies

2718
01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:29.956
that, often times,

2719
01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:29.956
were demonstrable frauds.

2720
01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:31.874
We point to $50 billion,

2721
01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.751
and that's like

2722
01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.751
an empirical number.

2723
01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.337
That's a number

2724
01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.337
we can say, "Boom."

2725
01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:39.299
We can point to this

2726
01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:39.299
and this fraud

2727
01:18:39.466 --> 01:18:41.342
and tie it in nicely on a bow.

2728
01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:44.304
What we don't talk about

2729
01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.932
is that there's hundreds

2730
01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.932
of billions of dollars

2731
01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:50.184
that we can't even

2732
01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:50.184
begin to touch.

2733
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.853
And the fraud

2734
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.853
that can be perpetrated...

2735
01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.773
through China

2736
01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.773
by other means.

2737
01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:57.775
So it's not $50 billion,

2738
01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.194
and it's not

2739
01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.194
some investment banks,

2740
01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:02.822
and it's not some people

2741
01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:02.822
in the United States.

2742
01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:06.826
It's everybody.

2743
01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:06.826
It's every bank.

2744
01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:10.288
(sirens wailing,

2745
01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:10.288
bell ringing)

2746
01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.461
Whether they know it or not.

2747
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:23.217
The Chinese e-commerce giant,

2748
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:23.217
Alibaba, took Wall Street

2749
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:23.217
by storm today.

2750
01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.470
The company

2751
01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.470
had its initial public offering

2752
01:19:25.637 --> 01:19:27.054
on the New York Stock Exchange.

2753
01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:29.557
Woman Reporter 2: The share

2754
01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:29.557
price jumped 38 percent...

2755
01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:30.891
This is a perfect storm.

2756
01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.479
This is a perfect storm.

2757
01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:37.106
Yeah, the eBay and Amazon

2758
01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:37.106
and PayPal is pretty easy,

2759
01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:39.317
but it's a Netflix;

2760
01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:39.317
it's a Groupon...

2761
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:41.027
I mean, it's a perfect storm.

2762
01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.697
It's the first time

2763
01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.697
a major Chinese Internet company

2764
01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:45.615
has gone public

2765
01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:45.615
in the United States.

2766
01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:50.995
Uh, there's an old joke that

2767
01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:50.995
the biggest lie on Wall Street,

2768
01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:53.623
is that this time,

2769
01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:53.623
it's different. (chuckles)

2770
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.709
Woman Reporter 2: Alibaba's

2771
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.709
profit for the second quarter,

2772
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:59.128
jumped some 179 percent

2773
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:59.128
to $2 billion.

2774
01:19:59.546 --> 01:20:00.672
It's a perfect storm.

2775
01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:02.923
That's what this is.

2776
01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.468
You don't have the ability,

2777
01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.468
to really research it.

2778
01:20:05.719 --> 01:20:07.220
You're buying lottery tickets.

2779
01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.764
Alibaba is lottery tickets.

2780
01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:13.017
Woman Reporter 2:

2781
01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:13.017
Charismatic founder, Jack Ma,

2782
01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:13.017
has the stage presence

2783
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.602
to rival many tech icons.

2784
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.271
Should we jump in

2785
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.271
and buy Alibaba stock?

2786
01:20:17.564 --> 01:20:18.939
Yeah, it's China.

2787
01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:20.900
Is there something looming

2788
01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:20.900
down the pike

2789
01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:24.571
that's even crappier than this?

2790
01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:24.571
I, I could make that argument.

2791
01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:27.114
Male Reporter: There's Jack Ma,

2792
01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:27.114
having met with the president.

2793
01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.033
Jack and I, are gonna do some

2794
01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.326
- great things.

2795
01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.326
- Small business.

2796
01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:31.827
- Thank you, Jack.

2797
01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:31.827
- Thank you, sir.

2798
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:37.250
The CEO of Alibaba,

2799
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:37.250
Jack Ma, says,

2800
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:37.250
"Just trust us, just trust."

2801
01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.169
In this country,

2802
01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.169
when anyone says,

2803
01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.338
"Just trust us,"

2804
01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.338
the first thing you do is,

2805
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:43.964
hold on to your wallet.

2806
01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:45.966
You don't trust anybody,

2807
01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.428
and you don't trust anything,

2808
01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.428
you can't see and research

2809
01:20:48.553 --> 01:20:49.763
for yourself.

2810
01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:51.806
And that goes for Alibaba too.

2811
01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:57.853
- Man: So why do you keep at it?

2812
01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:57.853
- Fuck 'em.

2813
01:21:00.231 --> 01:21:01.023
They're lying.

2814
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:06.404
(crowd cheering)

2815
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.281
(pop music playing)

2816
01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.908
Performer: Hot masseuse,

2817
01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.908
hot masseuse, right there.

2818
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:13.453
Here we go.

2819
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:13.453
Joe, bring your drink down here.

2820
01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:15.996
Come on.

2821
01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:15.996
Wait, we got it.

2822
01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.999
I just want to raise a toast

2823
01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.999
to all of us, all right?

2824
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:23.212
I want to raise a toast

2825
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:23.212
to an awesome 2015,

2826
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.256
to a great year,

2827
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.256
to being blessed,

2828
01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.383
to everything you want.

2829
01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.383
Here it comes, all right?

2830
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.427
Let's raise 'em up.

2831
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.427
Let's raise 'em up.

2832
01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:30.553
Raise your arms up.

2833
01:21:30.804 --> 01:21:32.138
(crowd cheering)

2834
01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.181
(guitar riff)

2835
01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:36.100
(crowd cheering)

2836
01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:38.352
Give us some house music.

2837
01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:38.352
Let's keep this party going.

2838
01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:42.898
(crowd cheering)

2839
01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:48.904
(drums playing)
